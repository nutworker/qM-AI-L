Britt Whitman at ex:5-4014 or Kristin Walsh at ex:3-9510.\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?\\nMOU Passes Assembly, Faces Fight in Senate ?\\nCPUC Direct Access Delayed by Senator  SoCal Developments As reported in the press this morning, the bailout passed the Assembly late last night by a 41-32 vote.\\nIt will now head to the Senate, where very significant opposition is expected.\\nAlong with his opposition to the changes made in the Assembly regarding the size of businesses that pay the dedicated rate component for the bailout, Senator Burton also has expressed privately that he is against paying twice book value for SoCal\\'s transmission assets.\\nSenator Places Hold on CPUC Direct Access Vote Regarding the CPUC\\'s decision to delay its hearings on the rate order and various other bond implementation measures (which led Treasurer Angelides to announce that the bond issue will have to be re-timed), this delay is due to a bill by Senator Burton that passed the Assembly Appropriations Committee yesterday.\\nBurton\\'s bill would take the place of the current proposed rate agreement (from Governor Davis) and would require greater disclosure and transparency in DWR ratemaking, as well as separate the payment streams for the bonds from payment streams for power.\\nIn doing so, Burton\\'s bill preserves more PUC authority than would be preserved under the rate order currently before the PUC - thus the delay in action.\\nPG&E also supports Burton\\'s bill, which is very likely to pass the Assembly and which the governor will likely have to sign.\\nIf this bill is signed, PG&E\\'s legal challenges to the DWR and PUC may be canceled.\\nThe popularity of Burton\\'s bill (as opposed to the rate agreement from the Governor) is leading many observers to conclude that Burton has replaced Davis as the most powerful, influential politician in California.\\nBurton\\'s goal is to ensure that any direct access that is offered to large users in 2003 (when there will be a dip in power procurement by DWR, resulting in a net short) is only temporary and does not turn into a \"jail break.\"\\nDWR\\'s power procurement will rise again in 2004; Burton wants to ensure that businesses will have to return to purchasing power from DWR at that time.\\nThe CTMA is opposed to Burton\\'s bill and to the bailout if no direct access is offered.\\nThe CTMA wants its members to be able to escape from buying power from the DWR (and therefore paying off the bonds) permanently in 2003.\\n\\n@subject\\nCalifornia Update 9-07-2001'),\n",

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) provided Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday with the $1.5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies' merger agreement, a Dynegy spokeswoman said.\\nDynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment.\\nThe cash infusion, which was made with the assistance of Dynegy's largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), is aimed at providing Enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations.\\nThe rights provide Dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger.\\nThe deal, which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next six to nine months.\\nDynegy is acquiring Enron for 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or about $10 billion based on the recent price of Dynegy shares.\\nThe acquisition of Enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about Enron's financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers.\\nThe dealings are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits.\\nDuring the last month, Enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated.\\nAs credit-rating agencies began to cut Enron's debt ratings threatening the company's investment-grade status, the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business.\\nIndustry experts viewed Dynegy's cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader's liquidity, and protect its most valuable business.\\nIn a conference call earlier Wednesday, Enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events.\\nAccording to Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser, the preferred stock Dynegy has received for its investment in Enron is convertible into the common stock of the Enron pipeline unit.\\nDynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into Enron shares if it desires, the spokeswoman said.\\nFor example, if Enron were to cancel its merger with Dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor, Dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into Enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in Enron's stock price, Rosser said.\\nIn either case, Dynegy wouldn't be required to pay any additional consideration.\\nDynegy was able to make the cash infusion after ChevronTexaco, of San Francisco, made an investment in Dynegy.\\nIf the acquisition closes as anticipated, ChevronTexaco, which owns about one-fourth of Dynegy, plans to make an additional $1 billion investment in the combined company.\\nChevronTexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $1.5 billion in Dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition.\\nEnron officials said they are monitoring the energy market's reaction to the cash infusion, and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties.\\nEnron remains on a credit watch at the credit-rating agencies.\\nMoody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's each have Enron rated one notch above speculative grade.\\n\\n@subject\\nEnron Receives Dynegy $1.5B Cash Infusion Tues. >DYN ENE\"),\n",

week.\\nSome of this is outside my purview, but want you to have the benefit of my objective, outside, reasonably well-informed perspective.\\nPlease call to discuss any of this at any time.\\n1.)\\nEstablish your own internal advisory group to plan/coordinate all company actions during this period.\\nMeet/call with full group at end of each day to assess develoments, adjust strategies, set next day\\'s actions.\\nIn my view, that group should include:  Bowen, Derrick, Delainey, Frevert, McMahon, Tilney.\\n(I am happy to participate at any time.)\\n2.)\\nI\\'d assign specific tasks to this core group and other senior execs.\\nas follows:  \\tBowen:  new IR point person.\\nHave him visit and re-visit sell-side analysts, provide update on status of core business, financing, promise ongoing communications, full disclosure, renewed commitment to candor, clarity.\\n(I can help prepare/advise him on this new role.)\\nDerrick: monitor SEC investigation, shareholder suits etc.\\nKeep tight leash on MacLusas and Wilmer Cutler.\\nEngage outside lawyers in discussion of SEC leak strategy, endgame and public relations implications.\\n(I have considerable experience in this space and would be happy to talk/work with Derrick to insure that the public face of this SEC investigation is seriously evaluated as part of Enron\\'s SEC strategy.)\\nDelainey:  have him spend his time meeting, calling, talking with wholesale and retail customers.\\nQuite similar presentation to that Bowen delivers to the Street.\\nHumility, candor, commitment to continue serving customers should be core thematics.\\nFrevert:    have him devote his time to calling on, talking with international customers with similar messages to those delivered by Delainey.\\nAlso have him take charge of wholesale review/potential revamp of Enron\\'s performance review/comp programs.\\n(This is where Herb Allison, Merrill\\'s former COO, could be helpful.)\\nMcMahon:    he\\'s your point person with lenders, ratings agencies.\\nI\\'d also have him work with Tilney to construct the clearest case statement possible explaining Enron\\'s strategy for is core businesses and why they are so compelling.\\nSuggestion:   Irwin Stelzer is the single best writer who can simplify complex issues that I know.\\nHe\\' s offered to help.\\nI encourage you to have him see whomever he needs to see and then write the Enron business strategy story.\\nHe\\'d also be a great spokesperson and advocate with Wall Street.\\nMight be worthwhile having Bowen take Irwin to a few key meetings with sell-side analysts.\\nI think Irwin would be a huge asset in that role.\\nTilney:\\t    have Beth make sure that every communication from Enron, internally and externally, is clear, concise, candid and responsive to each audience\\'s needs and expectations.\\nShe should manage Mark Palmer and his staff, Kekst people and any other communications resources (internal and external) that should be brought to bear druing this period.\\nWhalley:   have him spend all his time with your traders and those among counterparties with whom he is a critical factor.\\nI\\'d keep him away from the Street and from the media.\\nKean:\\t   have him focus solely on regulatory and legislative audiences.\\nHe should personally work federal and state regulators, Capitol Hill (members and staff) and present updated presentation about the company\\'s business, status of financials, status of internal reviews and SEC investigation.\\nI do think Steve\\'s core presentation should be vetted carefully by Derrick, McMahon and Tilney before he goes on the road.\\nPalmer:    I\\'d leave it to Tilney as to whether Mark should continue as principal spokesperson for Enron.\\nDon\\'t know if Tilney\\'s right, but I do think you need a new face and voice to the media.\\nKoenig:     I\\'d pull him back, have him work under Bowen to craft/refine presentations to the Street (in close coordination with MacMahon and Tilney).\\nAs we discussed, I think Koenig is damaged goods on the Street right now.\\nLay:\\t I think you should  act as the general who sets strategy, deploys your senior human assets and motivates your troops.\\nI think you should orchestrate every strategic action of the company,  talk regularly to employees, selectively call on strategic customers,  and reassure the world that Enron touches that you are \"in charge,\"  \"hands on,\" and doing \"everything possible\" to guide this damaged ship into safer waters.\\n3.)\\nEncourage the board Special Committee to prepare an Executive Summary of its report to you and the board that is entirely suitable for public consumption.\\n(I would be happy to help craft and edit that document.)\\nAssuming the report fundamentally exonerates the company, this is a critically important document.\\nYou must assume that this report will become public eventually.\\nIt is be prepared and submitted with that clearly in mind.\\n4.)\\nRetain a second investment bank to augment Goldman.\\nMy suggestions: talk with Jeff Holzschuh at Morgan Stanley or Bruce Wasserstein at Dresner Kleinwort Wasserstein.\\nLehman\\'s top energy people are gone and I think Rick Gordon/Merrill is seen as too close to you.\\nI\\'ve gone on too long.\\nLet me know how I can be specifically helpful to you and/or your colleagues.\\nI\\'ll

the largest wholesale merchant of natural  gas and power - saw                     wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53  per cent in the first                     quarter.\\nCritics argue that Enron\\'s move away from its familiar  energy business into                     new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the  competition                     entrenched, is risky.\\nYet a number of industry analysts  point out Enron has                     proved it understands markets and how to manage risks  while becoming the                     largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of  gas and power in the                     US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth.\\n\"It\\'s a prudent strategy, but it\\'s got to be done in an  orderly way,\" says Ronald                     Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York.\\n\"What  they\\'re doing here is                     what they\\'ve been incredibly successful at doing,\" he  adds, noting that Enron                     posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and  taxes (ebit) from its                     wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per  cent from the                     previous year.\\nEarnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of  the company\\'s overall                     income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr Barone  sees the unit\\'s ebit                     increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years.\\nAs with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is  standardising                     contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to  create markets by                     entering as a physical player and providing merchant,  risk management and                     financial services over the internet.\\n\"We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide  liquidity and we will                     provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract,\" Mr  Skilling says.\\n\"That is an                     extremely powerful model.\\nIf you look at other B2B sites,  they don\\'t do that.\"\\nMr Skilling argues Enron\\'s e-commerce platform will  triumph over the other,                     bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal  depends on two parties                     hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing,  price, credit and                     fulfilment.\\nNot everyone shares that view.\\nSome energy companies, for  example, would                     rather not do business with a competitor.\\nBP Amoco  recently purchased a 3                     per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston-  based, neutral                     wholesale energy exchange.\\nWith Koch Industries and  American Electric                     Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of  transactions on the                     site to lend it liquidity.\\nJust as in gas and power and now broadband and metals,  Enron believes it                     needs networks of strategic physical assets.\\nIn acquiring  MG, Enron got a                     stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical  position.\\n\"It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active  physical spot market                     in more markets in the world,\" says Greg Whalley, chief  executive officer of                     Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching to  identify and enter                     commodity markets.\\nHe argues that in metals and other  markets, Enron will                     deliver better pricing, price risk management services,  cross-commodity                     transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range  of customers.\\nMr Skilling says there are significant rewards for  restructuring an industry.\\n\"If you can take that platform, and you use the  capabilities the bricks bring to                     the table, e-commerce the industry and change the  structure, you\\'re selling for                     more than a 50 multiple.\"\\nCopyright , The Financial Times Limited\\n\\n@subject\\nB2B at Enron'),\n",
