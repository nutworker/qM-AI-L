3,"Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

4,"Tyson has had conversations with the Governor's office. The Governor's office wants more information about what the meeting would  ""look like""/attendees, and has said that the idea sounds like one worth  pursuing (but as we know, talk is very cheap with this Governor). In response, Tyson and her very able helper are taking the 1.5-pager that I  sent around and modifying it to describe the meeting  optics/logistics/attendee attributes, etc. They will forward it to me as soon as they've got it drafted. Tyson hopes the document will seal the deal on the Governor's participation. In the meantime, Tyson is trading calls with Doer and trying to line up other  business face cards to assist in getting the business community to the  table. Any help/suggestions we can offer gathering up business folks would  be useful, but seems that Tyson's going to have to carry that water. Tyson said based on her conversations with Summers, he's squarely on board.
