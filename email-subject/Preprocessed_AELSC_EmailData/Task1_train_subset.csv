4,Small world! ,"Hey John! How are you?? I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've thought of you a lot recently. I hope things are going well, despite the uncertainty. I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny story. Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled instead? John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's known since childhood and is a mentor of sorts. When he got off the phone, Chuck told me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar. I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes. So I tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John to ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him. Poor thing says ""yeah, that was me, but not one of my finer moments...""  I could tell he was embarrassed. I guess there are some things in life you just never live down. I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month. We shared a cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the same time. I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and is now doing really well. They immediately said ""John Arnold!"" Shocked the hell out of me, honestly. They were very funny in saying that I had made a ""bad trade"" by marrying my husband instead of you. I told them I would keep that in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't remember off the top of my head. They both work for a weather trading firm in the Northeast now, with Lynda Clemmons. Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today. I really do hope you're doing well.

9,Program Changes ,"Celeste,  I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the  program affect my eligibility for promotion. At the end of last year you  informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid  year review (my 2 year anniversary). It was my impression that the only  reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was  tenure. Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible  for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program. I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this  PRC? Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

12,"PJM West Implementation Delay to March 1, 2002 ","Transmission Customers:  Since FERC did not act on our September 11, 2001, PJM West compliance filing (Docket No. RT01-98-000) at its December 19th meeting, Allegheny Power (AP) will need to delay the start of the PJM West arrangement until March 1, 2002. In order to accommodate the further delay in the start date, AP will need to sell transmission service under the AP OATT and on the AP OASIS for the month of February 2002. To accomplish this, AP will do the following:  *	AP will attempt to call the Transmission Customers that have ""confirmed"" point-to-point transmission service reservations on the PJM OASIS for the paths that are not currently valid for PJM (AEP and DLCO) by 4:30 p.m. on December 21 to determine if they need comparable service on the AP system. If that is the case, AP will honor the ""confirmed"" reservations and the PJM OASIS timestamps. *	Yearly service that was not given the option to exercise roll-over rights on the PJM paths (AP to PJM and PJM to AP) will be given the option to extend that service through the month of February. AP will attempt to call these Transmission Customers by 4:30 p.m. on December 21. *	ATCs for the month of February will be uploaded to the AP OASIS starting at 8 a.m. on December 24. The upload will include all valid AP paths (AEP, PJM, VAP, FE and DLCO). *	Transmission Marketing will post a message on the OASIS when the ATC upload is started and when it is complete. *	Transmission service beyond March 1, 2002, will continue to be sold by PJM per the Interim Coordination Agreement that was filed with FERC on February 12, 2001. *	January 30, 2002, is the last scheduled FERC meeting in January. If FERC does not act on our filing at that time, the start of the PJM West arrangement may then be delayed until April 1, 2002. Further information will be provided at that time, if necessary.

18,Suggestions to help short term morale ,"Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting. Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but how about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there. Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level. Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting. Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it. Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed. We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more. I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to show up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring people running this company. Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about recent events. Let them feel like there is a real connection. Make it personal and regular. Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay. Lots of concerns but nobody running out the door at this point. I'll keep you posted.

21,Enron Europe New Account Opening Policy ,"Sally / Bill / Shawn  This is a quick note to let you know that as of Monday 1 October Enron Europe will be introducing a robust New Account Opening Policy for all trading counterparties. The Operational Credit team will be responsible for ensuring the smooth roll-out of the policy and for ensuring compliance with it. The salient points of the policy are that:  traders will be more accountable for relevant Regulatory and internal compliance concerning their counterparties; money laundering checks will be completed for all new counterparties prior to trading; the Compliance Group will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading; RAC will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading. These controls are already in place for the majority of Enron Europe's counterparties, however, the introduction of the Policy enables us to demonstrate this more effectively to the Regulators and to monitor compliance more easily.

When we look at numbers of confirmations and  compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which  activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed   to absorb increased business more easily. I also think that Jeff will be the  best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to  simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally. All of the  advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system,  auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm  group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for  implementation.

47,NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY ,"The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001. Stack Manager Modifications  Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager. Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose ""Fill order"". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack. Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices. No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose ""No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down"". Changes regarding Suspension of products  Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:  ? Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose ""Keep Awake"" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page. ? Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. ? Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

If you need more time to file your return, you can  easily get a filing extension. And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now,  you can buy more time to pay up. While you may be                            subject to interest and penalties for payments  made after April 16, you can put off the day of                            reckoning for months without fear that IRS  collection agents will come after you. There is even a                            loophole in the law that will enable many  individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being                            assessed interest or penalties. Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for  anyone who has yet to file his tax returns. You'll need                            to file either your tax return or an extension  request by the deadline. And to avoid interest and                            penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes  owed by April 16. April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA  contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first                            installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001. Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file  your return, getting a filing extension is simple. In fact,                            the IRS has expanded the options this year for  obtaining a filing extension. You can now do it by                            phone, computer or mail.

My fifth anniversary with Enron is coming up this Sunday, December 9. The Cash Balance Plan vests after five years and I want to make sure that HR's comments to me regarding the plan are right. HR (Sheila Walton) told me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid severance. With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable now. HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning. Benefits stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I would vest. HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is. If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on vacation and terminated after the 9th. I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my termination date after December 9, i.e. at the earliest next Monday.

The legal risks discussed in this memo were also set forth in the DASH; however, please note the following correction to the DASH:  while the Enron entities' pro rata share of the maximum potential liability under the seller indemnity is $20.7 million, Enron and the other sellers have joint and several liability for indemnification obligations which are capped at $30 million, and Enron will be liable for the entire $30 million if the non-Enron sellers cannot satisfy their pro rata share of the liability under the seller indemnity (note that Enron is not guaranteeing or backstopping the other sellers' share of this liability in any way; however, the purchaser may choose to hold Enron liable for the entire liability, and leave Enron to pursue the other sellers for their share).

70,Policy and other items ,"Rick  1	Limits. Here's how I interpreted the BOD approvals:  The BOD approved an aggregate of $150MM, with $50MM of discretionary VaR, plus the new policy which doesn't recognise the concept of discretionary VaR. So here's what I did:  Effectively I allocated all the $50MM of discretionary such that Pug's ""Big Buckets"" are now as follows:  US Gas				$100MM US Elec				$100MM Europe Gas & Elec			$35MM Global Products			$20MM Financials				$15MM Emerging Businesses		$20MM  If you have a calculator handy you'll see that this aggregates to $149.164MM (assuming zero correlation). At Business Unit level the individual commodity limits are unchanged, and I have put limits over the Business Units themselves as follows:  Enron Americas				$82MM EWS OOC (aka George Martingale)	$3MM  EEL					$34MM EGM					$23MM EIM					$8MM EBS					$4MM PGE					$4MM ETS					$1MM  Again I used root-sum-of-squares, and remember the original commodity limits (by VaR, net open and mat gap) are still in place (e.g. gas = $61MM as before). So that keeps it screwed down pretty tight and preserves the discretion between the ""Big Buckets"" and the Business Units. I spoke to Rebecca C who could only remember the decision outlined above, but offered to call Pug and let him know. I said I would come back on that. I think we should do that ourselves, possibly with Lay in the loop (?). Cleared it with Whalley today (he laughed), mentioned the dwindling membership of the Risk Management Committee and said ""In my current role I think I should be asking for limits, not approving them""  ...and then...  2	The gas desk lost $98MM yesterday  A combination of a very bullish AGA number (3 Bcf injection - not a typo - three Bcf !) plus some hurricane activity in the gulf sent prices up by between 25 and 30c all across the strip. The long and the short of it was we are long Nov - Jan but short (big-time) out beyond that - the rest is arithmetic. So we have two flavors of P&L notification, one at the business unit level (Americas) $89MM loss against VaR limit of $82MM; the other as a commodity, losing $126MM (the desk aren't the only ones with a gas position, as usual) against the Big Bucket number of $100MM. Total trading was a loss of $106MM against a VaR limit of $150MM so no calls to Pug required (thank goodness). That's it for now, hope you're having fun and remember: pan-fry the big ones and throw back the little ones. DP  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

84,MIS ,"barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:    While being entertained at the latest OSS working group meeting,  the limitation of being able to only schedule MIS 14 days in advance was brought up. Once upon a time, when business rules and bidding rules were changing faster then tires on pit row, it was agreed to limit the entries to 14 days in order to avoid having long term deals fail (as per nameless NYISO guy). Now that things have slowed down and bidders are more savvy and able to babysit their bids, we should be looking to expand the time frame for placing longer term bids in MIS. An  informed NYISO guy (different guy by the way) said it would be easy and using 4-5 man days to do. I have talked to Ray Kinney (Chair of the S&P WG) and gave him the same song. If your shop would like to see the MIS limit lifted, have your representative to the S&P WG help it along. Please don't bother Ray directly or my TIE messages will rerouted to the Quilting Forum.

The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days. NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved. The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market. Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding. NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections. (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities. The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project. Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes. ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational. Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

95,"Environmental findings, Koch South Texas Records Review ","Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were  identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch  facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year. All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the  Koch office  were reviewed. Assumptions were made that the environmental  records were complete for all assets included in the sale. Primary emphasis  was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a  sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of  crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical  assets which were reviewed. Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the  following:    Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee  payments were documented     NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks  were documented     Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date    SARA compliance and reporting had been completed    SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112    Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were  available for review     There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site  included in the asset for sale      (permits for the remediation activity is in place)    Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were  documented  Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified  which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a  considered a major environmental  liability. This statement is again based  upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the  data room for the assets in question. It should also be stated that this  analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch  has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge  during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files. Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a  recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to  each location to verify findings from the records review. Also, due to the  past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract  conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for  discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have  occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

96,Phone Conversation with TNC ,"Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature  Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She  was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts  to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may  have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project. Although the proposed  route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did   offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area  which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix. The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological  regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and  animals. The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions. The  TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be  used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed  prior to construction and approval by FERC. To the south and east of  Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of  ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species  which live in and around the area of the River. This river could be  impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction  across Arizona. I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition  to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the  environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the  pipeline corridor route. Part of this concern is due to the extensive and  unique biological diversity of Arizona. I think we will have a better handle  on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this  piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful  the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.

97,Additonal Information Concerning PG&E ,"On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was  suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system. It is as follows:   2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank,  2-10.84 drip locations  The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above  PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000. I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their  C/S. They quoted a turn key price of $34,000. Because this piping belongs  to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves. If the decision  is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done  during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities. I will also  need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology  to be used. Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes  to 36"". One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas  compressors. In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were  found at regulated levels.....

98,"Fuel Consumption, La Plata A ","Guys, I received Harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and  the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the  permits fuel use requirements. My question is, how does the fuel use compare  with what Solar says the fuel use should be? If we can get Solar to provide  written guarantees and ""UP"" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the  fuel value on the permit. The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use  beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in  need of mechanical adjustment. From their eyes, this would be a strong  indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some  merit. Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado. Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the  monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata? Then let me know. If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another  tactic, but only as a last resort.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

122,Minutes from last Thurs' CAISO Board Meeting (Sorry for the delay) ,"CAISO BOG 10/25/01 Notes taken by G. Alan Comnes  Meeting went from about 10:30 to 1 p.m. Written materials discussed at this meeting are available at www.caiso.com/bog. 1. Budget. Board approved budget, which contains a significant increase in GMCs and, for the first time applies GMC fees, on the self provision of A/S. The motion to adopt was modified to say the Board would revisit budget if, in response to Gov. Davis requests to par budgets, the CAISO budget is cut. 2. Retirement plan Audit 3. Allocation of Above-MCP 487 charges. This mechanism will improve the allocation of OOM costs so that the per-MWh charges match up with actual OOM costs. Stated that penalty revenues used to lower OOM costs could come from imbalance penalties. Action. approved (?) to allow staff to make a tariff amendment on this change. 4. Winter Assessment. Presentation by staff  Kahn took issue (i.e., did not even want staff report presented) that CAISO does an assessment without consulting the Power Authority, CPUC, and the CEC. Worried about conflicting with the other resource assessments out there and giving media ways to take shots at DWR buying practices. In the end, the full presentation was not given but questions were asked about whether the assessment spells trouble or provides assurance. The answer:  things are tight in some months but are expected to be ok given the level of conservative assumptions used in the analysis. Action: staff was tasked to compare this assessment with CEC's and others and come back in another month. 5. Generator maintenance program. Will use GADS data. This program is mandatory for PGA generator units. CAISO staffer represented that no other ISO has a prescriptive program like the one CAISO is proposing. Current schedule:  brief FERC staff next week, return to Board in November for approval, make FERC filing, implement in early '02. Benchmarks are based on each unit's historical performance; i.e. dogs will be benchmarked against their past doggy behavior. There is no component to raise the ""bar"" on performance but a unit that falls relative to past performance would trigger further review. 6. MSC Selection Committee. MSC provides ""independent"" review of the CAISO markets for CAISO, the state, and FERC. Wolak is the only member left at the moment. Selection committee will be Sheffrin, Wolak, and Borenstein. Candidates will go to Exec. Director and the final candidates to the Board in February 2002 (!). Kahn questioned how the MSC can survive with only one member and take until February 02 to select a final members. Nonetheless, the glacially paced schedule was adopted. 7. FERC RTO Seams Issues. Steve Greenleaf presented. Updated BOG on RTO week and said that the ""4 RTO"" model took a step backward (""off the table"" in the words of Chair Wood) in response to criticism from state PUCs on Thursday. (Is this an accurate recounting of Day 4?). ISO is engaged in interregional coordination. Mentioned ""CSIC"" group   Mentions SSGWY's (? )sponsorship of a market monitoring workshop on November 16. 8. Update of CERS Settlement BEEP/AS Payment Procedure. Edison and PG&E ""are making progress"" but no agreement with CERS have been reached. SDG&E signed and the procedure was implemented at least in part with SDG&E. 9. Monthly reports: financial. 10. Monthly reports: DMA. Sheffrin. Mostly followed the briefing charts. Emphasized the following: CERS OOM purchases are generally down and are reasonably priced once purchases and sales are disaggregated. Said that suppliers are still bidding above costs. DMA files confidential reports that include info on bidding data weekly to FERC. Bids are not coming down. Intrazonal congestion is up due to new generation coming on line.

125,URGENT: The California business community needs your help ,"SVMG ENERGY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, LIAISON REPRESENTATIVES & PRINCIPAL OFFICERS:  The California business community needs your help in opposing AB67 XX. This bill represents a dangerous attempt to rewrite SB78 XX, the Edison bail-out legislation, which passed the Assembly last Friday. After months of good faith discussions the amendments the California Business Coalition so strongly advocated for have been completely disregarded. Direct Access continues to be threatened and an unfair rate increase for large energy users still lingers. We urge you to contact your local delegation to express your opposition to this inequitable legislation. The Senate will be voting on SB67 XX immediately. If passed, the bill will go to the Assembly for vote tomorrow morning. Please contact members of both houses so that the concerns of the California business community are clearly heard. Attached please find the Business Coalitions floor alert, the SVMG's letter opposing SB67 XX, as well as a spreadsheet with contact information for our local legislative delegation.

127,CSFB Independent Power Weekly--Issue #44 ,"<<IPW092401.pdf>>  Good Morning,  Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly. Also note that there is a replay available of our conference call, which took place last week. The dial-in number is 402/220-7493. The PIN # is 7493. The call featured Judah Rose from ICF Consulting. Topics discussed included: 1. Recent trends in the US power market; 2. Their impact on the generation supply chain; and, 3. The relationship between GDP and power demand. A copy of the slides that accompanied Judah's presentation is available upon request. Summary: 1. IPP's Fall 5.1%   Last week our our IPP composite declined 15.4%, outperforming the NASDAQ (-15.7%), but underperforming the S&P 500 (-11.1%). NRG Energy, which was down 8.8%, was the strongest generator in the group. International Power was the weakest performer, declining 30.5%. 2. Generation Oriented Utilities Fall 6.9%   Our universe of generation oriented utilities fell 6.9%, outperforming all the major market indices. DTE Energy, which was down 2.7%, was the strongest performer in the group. PPL was the weakest performer, declining 13.5%. 3. IPPs Trading 24% Below Private Market Asset Value   Importantly, our analysis indicates that all the major US IPPs are now trading at or below the private market values of their assets. As a group, the major IPPs are trading at a 24% average discount to their private market asset values. NRG Energy and Reliant Resources are trading at the most significant discounts to their private market values-33% and 34%. 4. Disparity Between Public and Private Market Valuations is Unsustainable We believe this situation is unsustainable and envision 3 scenarios that could play out. 1. Stock prices may simply rebound correcting the valuation disparity; 2. IPPs limit the amount of capital allocated to new plant construction and pursue share buybacks or acquisitions of other IPPs; or, 3. Traditional utilities (both domestic and foreign) or other entities from outside the industry pursue acquisitions of IPPs. Regards,  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

130,Booked PX Credits ,"Jeff,  I have attached a file showing the SCE receivable amount of ($109,292,004.75) Due Enron. This amount is net of the payments made by SCE. A few cautions, these amounts are reported more by Enron accounting month vs. utility bill cycle month. But at least it highlights the rapid fall off starting in the March, when most of the customers had been returned to Bundled Utility Service. To obtain a more accurate projection of the receivable as of January 18, 2001 or at any point would require this information be sorted differently and require allocation assumptions to handle the bill cycle vs. accounting vs. PX end date. Hopefully this will be enough to get you ready for Monday's meeting. Call me if you would like to discuss. FYI, I have also included information re PG&E. If you are asked, these amounts are directly from the utility bills, not an Enron's calculation. We have not really tried to ""tie"" these numbers with the utility, but in all cases these amounts were pulled directly from the utility bills. Any errors would be due to omissions or query compilation errors. EES could be prepared to actually reconcile these with SCE, if you give the go-ahead to do so. Let me know what you think, or if you need anything else. If you follow Rick's suggestion, it might be a short meeting anyway. Wanda  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

137,Implementation of the Suspension Direct Access -- UDCs' Plan ,"On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for implementing the suspension of direct access. Parties have until, Wednesday, November 28th, to comment. The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek Commission approval:  1. A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001. 2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers, they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20, 2001. 3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party verification took place prior to September 20, 2001. 4. Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place on or before Sept. 20th. 5. Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed. 6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list. 7. If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required; requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001. 8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed). 9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights to another. 10. Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be allowed. In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for implementing the suspension. 1. The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and accepted). 2. If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to receive DA. The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay from the Commission. 3. The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set forth a proposed affidavit.)

142,Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will  continue for years ,"Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for  years (Published July 24, 2001)  The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more  intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee  sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn  over internal documents. Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has  adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple  investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has  become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians. At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted  criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. ""I would love  to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a  tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' "" Lockyer said. With  less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based  companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.
143,Rumor That The Legislature May Reconvene ,"Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly  members back. So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make  a run at this. We are getting more information and mobilizing industry. Some key considerations:  The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something  done. The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having ""done  nothing."" Becauase the Assembly has thus far ""done nothing,"" the only thing it has in  front of it is 78. The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill  was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided. So there's a  reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order  to get the support necessary to get voted out. Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where  the Senate would have to approve it. Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and  call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that  Burton's inclined to come back. In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes  to 78, that ""it's 78 or nothing."" Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e.,  Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's  amendments. Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye  on the issues. All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be  counted out.

Erik could you copy your vitals  (title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they  can forward along to Alpert? Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could  make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if  needed):  The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from  Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made  the customer better off. Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and  should have going forward. Any ""solution"" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the  continuation of Direct Access for all customers. As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that  Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy. Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase  costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.

Dennis' declaration says that the situation in California  has been a ""financial disaster,"" that ""Enron has lost over $300 million,"" and  that ""Enron stands to lose millions more."" The losses are described as  ""huge."" Perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the  market, but I'm not aware of it. And if it hasn't, it could represent a  significant conflict with previous statements. Seems prudent to run this by  IR and perhaps others before releasing.

174,Quicksilver Resources ,"Ken and Jeff:  Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine. Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver. Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK). Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron. Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today. Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering. I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding. If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board. However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron. As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry. I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility. Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position. Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further. Thanks.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

191,PROS Energy Web Seminar Series - a Resounding Success ,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  PROS Revenue Management's Energy Web Seminar Series  a ""Resounding Success""  December 10, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in revenue management science and software, and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced the success of its Energy Profit Optimization Web Seminar Series held December 5-7, 2001. Each seminar in the series discussed the benefits of PROS commercial optimization systems in the natural gas industry. Each seminar included case studies which provided participants an insight to the practical applications of PROS science-based optimization systems. Focused on pipelines, storage, and trading, these seminars enabled participants from various areas of the energy industry to take advantage of pricing and revenue optimization best practices. ""These seminars were a resounding success,"" says Matt Johnson, PROS' Senior VP of Energy. ""PROS is continuing to take the leadership role for transfer of our mature revenue management science and technology into the energy industry. Based on the positive feedback of key energy first-movers, we anticipate several more of these innovative, interactive seminars in 2002. These sessions allowed attendees to have access to free, informative business case studies reflecting state-of-the-art energy revenue management."" The PROS Trading Optimization System can increase gas trading profitability by 10-15% by generating the optimal routing of supply to market given all pipeline contract constraints, gas purchase and sale obligations, and trading opportunities. The system recommends optimal spot gas buy/sell strategies and provides real-time physical position and opportunity cost data between any two points on the pipeline network. The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds. The PROS Storage Revenue Management System has been shown to increase revenues from the sale of storage capacity by 7-25% after initial implementations. This system provides pipelines, storage marketers and traders with the ability to maximize revenue from the sale of storage services and contracts. It provides the comprehensive ability to analyze the value of storage using PROS' state-of-the-art revenue management science and to execute and track those deals in real-time. The PROS Transportation Revenue Management System has demonstrated a revenue lift of 7-15% for firm transportation services in both open-season and negotiated sales environments. It allows natural gas pipelines to maximize revenue from the sale of transportation capacity. The system uses PROS' mature forecasting technology to predict demand for transportation contracts and forecast the customer utilization of existing contracts.

192,Socal Window Meeting ,"Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures. No hand-outs were provided. Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock  540 mmcf/d Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d Needles 800 mmcf/d Wheeler 800 mmcf/d  New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d Both will be available around Feb 1  Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system. Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations. New Calculation, Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance. SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points. Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select. Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts. Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections. Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast. They use Weather Bank as one of their tools. OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select  Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well. Lots of complaints. People were complaining that it restricted access to the system. Eliminating point specific calculation. Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits. Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures. No changes to Wheeler Ridge. Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle. Replace windows with operational maximum volumes. If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows. Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 . No direct dial-up. Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party. However, can still make  changes. Can still upload new files. 2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO. Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers. Gas Select is official notification. Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail. Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free. OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific. OFO's can be declared intraday. Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day. Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on. Don't want to go back and forth. This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works. Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned. Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage. Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week. Can revise expected usage. No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO. Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy. Generators need to revise expected usage. Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal. Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4. Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed. If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules. Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised. If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:  Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized. Will allocate prorata. Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point. In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered. For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week. Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume. For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes. For example:           Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4  In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th. ; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th. Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes. All customers must comply. Minimum delivery requirements 50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;) 70% of daily usage depending on storage level 70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min 90% of daily usage depending on storage level 90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min. Look at storage graph on Gas Select. Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed. If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect. Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule. Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,  Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account. Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ. Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group) Not subject to 70% and 90% rules. 2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas. As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count. Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement, Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement. Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period. Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges. Rate is posted at end of every month. OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

198,Transport contracts ,"Steve,   I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July  2000. Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC. But since  our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where  HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase. ENA then transports the  gas to a delivery point. If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an  additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery  point. This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and  completing the scheduling in reasonable time. Plus, it just doesn't make  sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as  HPLC. Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned. Thanks for your help.

206,BNSF ,"Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any  ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad. In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter. Apparently, a bunch of  utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to  figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative. If the RR owns  its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be  able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate. In other words,  the RR would be treated just like any other landowner. If we did that, Dave  thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war. Since our lines cross or  parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that  would be foolish. I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was  interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW  without too much pain. If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to  suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this. Assuming we  can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the  appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW  should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we  decide to go forward. Other than the BNSF issue, I don't think we have any specific ""to dos"" or any  specific comeback date to Dennis and Tino. So what do you guys think should  happen next?

209,Confidentiality Regarding Acquisitions ,"I'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of  activity lately related to Enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions. John  Goodpasture's group has kept a large number of ET&S people engaged in looking  at a number of potential deals. While these deal evaluation projects have  become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are  extremely confidential. Even after a potential seller has announced that it  is up for sale, the fact that Enron is looking at a potential deal, as well  as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential. I realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees  of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the  future. If you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at  the target company asks whether Enron is evaluating the contact's company or  assets, the only appropriate response is that Enron personnel are not  permitted to discuss potential acquisitions. Please be aware that the  confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition  evaluation process preclude any communication by Enron people with employees  of the target company. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do  not hesitate to give me a call. Thank you for your assistance. DF  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.
210,Pueblo ,"Tino called today to report on their meetings with DOE last week. Tino,  Dennis Langley, and their outside lawyer Jim Slattery met with Bill  Richardson and DOE staff to discuss the ""sole source"" procurement approach to  DOE's obtaining an alternative power supplier for Kirtland AFB and Sandia. Tino reports that Richardson signed off on the sole source approach, subject  only to DOE review of the final contract to assure its consistency with the  public interest. Tino believes that the combination of significant Native  American involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price  that is lower than DOE's current PNM rates will satisfy the ""public interest""  standard. Slattery is set to begin discussions with DOE next week on the overall  structure of Dennis' proposal. I am surprised that Dennis would go this far  before hearing from us on the economics, but Tino made it sound like the  initial discussions would be fairly general--i.e., to explain to DOE that the  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

212,Pueblo ,"Another Tino-gram. DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a $7.06/mo  demand charge per KW in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge. Tino didn't  know whether that was per KW of monthly demand, per KW of non-coincident peak  usage, or what. The PNM tariff for govt. service is priced at $7.16/KW of  ""demand above 10,000kw during peak period""  (peak period is daytime) so I  assume that is how it is calculated. If that is the tariff (""Schedule  4000B"") under which DOE really takes service, this is interesting because  that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate. It is also  interesting that DOE is paying $.053/kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B  energy rate is $.05072/kwh (maybe the difference is surcharges or something). Tino's consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an  incremental $.011 in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge, for a total  delivered PNM rate to DOE of $.064/kwh. This is not as good as the 7 cent  number Tino threw around earlier in the week, but its still not terrible. If  the bogey is a 10% reduction to the current rate, our number to beat is  $.0576/kwh. Tino promised us copies of DOE's actual energy bills to confirm  these numbers. That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you  and I talked about yesterday, Kevin. Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta's consultant that the  Cobisa Belen project is dead. Do we know anything about this??? Interesting. I'm waiting to hear back from Bill Votaw to line up a due  diligence call to Tino's government contracts lawyers in DC to confirm  whether the ""sole source"" strategy is legit.

I was at the game and it was as if the  Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put  together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff. They were out of  position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play. I like Brown  and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to  coach. I lay this all at his feet. Obviously the coordinators bear some  major responsibility as well. I really don't know what to expect for the  remainder of the season. They obviously are not as bad as they showed on  Saturday. But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly  on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could  be humiliated. I was very wrong. Something has to change. The fact is they  are 3-5 in the last 8 games. And were favored in all but one. Lack of  talent is no longer an excuse. I think the entire remainder of the season  hinges on this Saturday. If they play as poorly as they have all season  (they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado,  they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of  the question.

269,Another Version of Negative CTC Risk? ,"I have a concern about Enron's forward-looking exposure associated with legacy deals (deals that existed during the June 2000 through the May 2001 price shock). If Edison gets its way, all customers will pay for Edison's under-recovery from June 2000 through January 2001 plus CDWR spot market purchases during 2001. This would take the form of a surcharge on future bills. My concern is that Enron will be on the hook for these future charges associated with past under-collections -- even beyond the term of our legacy deals. For example, if a deal ends in March 2002 we could be on the hook for surcharges that a legacy customer would receive on its bill after that date, provided the surcharge pertained to costs incurred by the utility during the time that the legacy customer was ours.

273,Northwest Reserves ,"We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds. $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book. During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001. Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI. The claims totaled close to $100 million. However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious. For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding. We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process. One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market. That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk. I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million. We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million. In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC. The draft decision recommended against any refunds. This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year. If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

Option 2:	Leave Stan and Cindy on 50; Move you, Danny, whomever you and Stan decide to the empty offices on 50. Also, to consider in an effort to consolidate the Danny McCarty's organization back into more functional environments:  Level 30 is currently being used for Disaster Recovery thru year-end. Levels 31 and 32 are vacant and available to us now. Both floors are high density (trader desks), approximately 280 desks per floor. However, these floors present a problem situation for Shelly et al because of Gas Control location. Level 44 has high density (188 cubes), and would be the fastest and most economical solution to fit Danny/Shelley groups on one floor in the upper stack. The only down side to this floor is the lack of offices and team rooms -- only 7 offices and 1 large conference room.

Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt of the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. 3. Section 6. Jurisdiction. We think that New York Jurisdiction is a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of derivatives trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan.

Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially. I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine. Now, for the Important Question. MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15. I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path). If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP. Also let me know how prevalent that practice is. MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.

I'm not really up to discussing this today. To make a long story short, I plan to catch the 2:30 p.m. bus home today. I will be back in tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. and at full speed.

320,"Use of ""exchange"" in corporate name ","FYI  Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at  Cadwalader to determine if using the word ""exchange"" in a corporation's name  would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC. Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word  ""exchange"" . As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing  so without concern. He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in  using ""exchange"" in your corporate name, however, putting ""exchange"" in a  company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny. He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong,  so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea.

Everything between now and April is  already full with large waiting lists. If he is really interested he should  try and sign up for classes immediately. He can do that by going to the  ""Development Center"" Icon (aka ""Ernie""). Then he can sign up on the computer. External NYMEX Class:  I checked with the local NYMEX office, and their next classes are as follows:  June 7 - Introduction to NYMEX Products June 14 - Intermediate Hedging (intro class a prerequisite) June 17 - Intermediate Options (intro class a prerequisite)  Like the internal classes, the NYMEX classes also fill quickly. Their  February classes are already full. As I also mentioned, the first weekend in April is when the Roundtop Antiques  Festival is. It is a great way to see the countryside outside of Houston,  all the local towns around Roundtop also have antique festivals at that  time. The wildflowers should be in bloom, and that is alway impressive. With the cold weather and rain, we might have a really good year for  wildflowers this year.

I understand that you have a wealth of experience in real options and that this is an area that Enron is extremely committed to. I would love to invite you to come along and speak as I think that you would make a vital addition to the programme. Your colleague Shirley recommended that I email some details over first of all - I hope you don't mind. I have drawn up a draft programme (attached below) based on my research, but please do bear in mind that this is very much a developing programme and if you have any comments I'd really like to hear them. Also if you feel that you would like to present an area that I have not covered in the programme or would like me to rewrite a session I would be more than happy to do so. I know that you are extremely busy and must get approached regularly to speak at conferences, however I really do believe that this will be a fantastic opportunity to publicise Enron as a leader across Europe. We will be marketing this conference to over 40,000 targeted individuals, including a direct mail of at least 25,000 and in addition an online and press campaign. We will be looking to work with leading industry press such as Petroleum Review, Oil and Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine and Harts E&P and can also undertake mailings for our speakers and sponsors to their contacts and clients. Just to let you know of my deadlines, I am working to a very tight deadline and will need confirmation by Thursday 14th June if you are interested in getting more involved in this programme. I appreciate that this is very short notice, but at this stage I would need very little from you. You would simply need to choose an appropriate session or I can adapt a short abstract for you and I can co-ordinate with your assistant to get a biography for the brochure. I look forward to hearing from you soon and sincerely hope that you can make it. Kind Regards,  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.
367,new bldg- book space- library? ,"Vince-  Are you going over to the new building right away? The reason I ask is on the trading floor the workspaces are very small, and there is no room whatsoever for books (eg, econometrics texts). I think this revives the issue of a library. We used to have a wonderful one, then it went away. I was wondering if you could keep a thought in the back of your mind in terms of a place where people could go to find and read good textbooks.

369,Thank You For Your Time and Hospitality ,"Vincent....on behalf  of Toshiba Corporation, we wanted to thank you for the valuable time you spent  with us on Tuesday and also for the great Brennan's Lunch! We hope you and your  team felt that the time was well spent and you found the Boltzmann concepts and  model to be both interesting and compelling. We know that we  threw alot of very detailed information at you in a relatively small amount of  time and of course it will take some time to digest. We're thinking that  the best way forward may be a small research or prototype project where Enron  and Toshiba may be able to jointly test, analyze and benchmark the application  of this concept -- to determine it's feasibility and potential business  benefit. We are very interested in your thoughts about this  idea.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.
370,Rice Energy Club Roundtable topics ,"Dear John, dear Vincent,   Let me up-date you on the roundtables we decided in the last meeting to focus on during the rest of the academic year. The original idea was to keep the number of events from 3 to 4 roundtables each semester. The result of the last meeting with all members was driven by enthusiasm, and as you see below we produced a prolific list of 13 subjects. Maybe you can help us to narrow down to a reasonable number, 12 events (one we had yesterday) by May 2002 we think are too many. I also would take this opportunity to update on the ongoing relationships with the most prominent industry in the sectors and have your feedback, suggestion on how to group them in the roundtable. We got great support so far from Reliant, Enron, Mirant, Schell (Coral), Bp, Duke. El Paso, Chevron-Texaco, Phillips, and Halliburton etc.. also are interested and we will present the club to them as well. The major challenge for us is not transform the Energy Club in a Finance Energy Club. At Rice we already have a Finance club and it works very well. We want first educate about the energy industry in general, and second present the opportunities for MBAs in the industry in different areas, including finance but not limited to. Topics of Roundtable Meetings:   0) Energy ""101""  1) Corporate Finance (Treasurer or Controller) 2) Energy Consulting 3) Financial Services (trading, risk management) 4) Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) - Marteen 5) Project Development, strategic planning 6) Project Finance 7) Project Risk Management 8) Regulation, Deregulation, and Restructuring - Reliant done 9/17/2001 9) Structuring of Products 10) Supply Chain 11) Telecom - Broadband 12) Venture Capital within energy industry - Brian, Paresh   Thanks in advance for your precious suggestions and I am looking forward to meeting you.

371,Cash needs ,"Vince,  I was thinking that max (negative)  potential exposure for different counterparties could occur for different scenarios and so combining max potential exposure across counterparties may overstate cash needs. If overall scenario for overall max (negative) potential exposure is considered, then we will pick up some high exposures and some low exposures, which may be fine. Alternately, why not tweak the potential exposure program to do deterministic shifts of one sigma and two sigma and assuming one factor model and perfect correlation across commodities. Then the negative mtm values can be compared to collateral already outstanding. This method does not guarantee that we will get large exposures, but is easy to explain. Another thing to check with Winston is that the program does not automatically zero out negative exposures. If it does, then we may have to flip the sign for all positions, get the exposures, then flip back the sign. Then compare to collateral outstanding.

373,VaR ,"David,  During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations. Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery  is poor  and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the  problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves. We have agreed on the following:  1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can  increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will  investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run. 2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity  should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense  to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less  transparent aggregates. 3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be  systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the  trading positions. This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the  responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical. Vince  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with  a numerical estimate of the value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has  distributional consequences: he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of  the value of this option could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific;  so we shall rather  produce a template you can use for valuation case by case. Vince Kaminski  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

382,Bryson Conversation ,"Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay:  Urged us to ""stay at the table"". Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from  which to calculate offering prices). QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased  forward (perhaps by state entity). Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost  based at  4?/kwh. If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6? ), there is room under the 7? new  commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40%  of SCE supply). Says good progress was made today. Believes they may have a framework this  evening. Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as  high as 6.0?). Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government  facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution. Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power. Says securitization may be harder to get. Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear  payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities  over the next several weeks. Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the  progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson. Let's discuss at 10:30 call tomorrow.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

406,Special Assets--Enron Executive Services ,"For several months we have been working on an idea to exploit the staff and experience we have in Special Assets to develop a fee-for-service ""executive services"" business. The key idea is to participate in potentially rewarding companies and projects without commitment of Enron's investment capital. I believe that this would be a logical extension in applying the skills and management approach we already are taking with our own portfolio. As part of some initial feasibility evaluations, we recently have had discussions with Bill Gartland, a Houston entrepreneur, with extensive contacts with national and provincial governmental development agencies in Spain. Gartland is seeking management and financial expertise to promote industrial, commercial and real estate projects in Spain. Among other things, he presently lacks the professional skills to evaluate and package projects for presentation to sophisticated capital providers in the United States and Europe. In addition to checking personal and business references, we had Rick Carson's group perform a due diligence review of Mr. Gartland. His background and reputation are clean. Through Gartland's contacts we have been invited to meet with representatives with the Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Indrustriales (SEPI), the Spanish state-owned holding company for business development. In addition, we will meet with representatives of Instituto de Fomento (INFO), the regional government of Murcia's business development group. INFO has agreed to fund all of our incountry expenses while in Murcia on this initial visit. In order to take advantage of this opportunity we have accelerated our plans to test the market for the types of services we envisage providing and are scheduled to meet with SEPI, INFO and other contacts in Spain the week of June 11th. Unfortunately, with the tight schedule we could not arrange a general meeting to cover the concept of Enron Executive Services (EnronExec). However, we have prepared an informal presentation as a briefing prior to next week's trip. I would stress the following points:  These initial meetings are informational and relationship focused. No commitments will be made next week. One of the key principles of EnronExec is that we are not a source of capital. Among the services we offer will be analysis of capital needs and preparation of business and/or project plans for presentation to capital providers. Activities contemplated for EnronExec will complement the normal workload of Special Assets. There will be no reduction in our efforts to achieve our primary business objectives for the team. The expenses to evaluate the potential and, if viable, to startup the activity are modest and are consistent with our approved 2001 expense plan. Our eventual objective to fund EnronExec is to structure cash fees at least sufficient to cover staff time and out-of-pocket costs. We will look to acquire significant equity participation that would offer the attractive potential value upside. As a byproduct benefit through contacts with various businesses, we may identify new synergies and opportunities for other Enron businesses. I am very enthusiastic on EnronExec. It appears that it may be a way to leverage Enron's unique resources and strengths into a profitable enterprise that does not require separate capital. I would appreciate your comments and questions.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

414,Request For Assistance ,"Mr. Lay:  I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping to strengthen a relationship EES has with Sysco Corporation. EES and Sysco began discussing a wide array of business opportunities with one another in the Fall of last year. On June 30th of this year, we entered into a 10 year electricity supply contract for all of Sysco's California facilities. We are currently pursuing two important Q4 transactions with Sysco; an electricity supply contract for their Texas facilities and a demand side management contract for all of their facilities. We had planned to close the Texas supply transaction today. However, in a phone conversation I had this morning with Sysco's Director of Procurement, Terry Taylor I was informed that Sysco's CEO, Charles Cotros has instructed Mr. Taylor not to enter into any further transactions with us ""until Enron's financial picture clears up"". Mr. Taylor believes that Mr. Cotros' concerns about Enron would be diminished if he received a call from a senior executive at Enron. Rosalee indicated that you and Mr. Cotros serve together on the Board of Directors for the Greater Houston Partnership. Would you please call Mr. Cotros and attempt to assuage his concerns about our financial condition. Mr. Cotros is out of the office until Thursday, November 1st. His direct phone number is (281) 584-1415. His assistant is Andrea Walters and her phone number is (281) 584-1405. Mr. Cotros' biography is as follows:     Charles H. Cotros, age 64, has served as a director of SYSCO since 1985. Mr. Cotros has served as Chairman of the Board since July 2000 and as Chief Executive Officer since January 2000. He served as Chief Operating Officer from 1995 until January 2000 and as President from 1999 until July 2000. He has been employed by SYSCO since 1974. Mr. Cotros is Chairman of the Executive Committee and he is also a member of the Finance Committee. Source: Proxy, 9/24/01  Thank you in advance for your consideration and anticipated assistance.

Second, I wanted to  make sure you were aware of what I think may be a great public relations  opportunity for Enron. I think you may have already heard from Kathy  Whitmire about it. While at a Scenic America board meeting at Harlan  Crow's Camp Topridge (you may have been there), I learned about Scenic America's  upcoming program on PBS. This will consist of a series of six airings of a  30 minute documentary on Scenic America, its mission and the issues with which  it is involved. Kathy Whitmire was at the meeting as was Carroll Shaddock,  founder and chairman of Scenic Texas. A substantial advertising discount  is being made available to the corporation that sponsors this documentary. This might be a perfect match for Enron, especially in light of your  demonstrated commitment to the missions of Scenic America and its  affiliates. At any rate, I hope  you will give this your consideration. Thanks so much for your ongoing  help and support.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

A year ago I was apologised to by the Human Resources Department and told that they would not allow it to happen again. Through constant pressure and the unfair way in which I have been treated, the advice of my doctor and counsellor, as they are concerned with my health, was to accept the voluntary redundancy which had been offered to my colleagues and myself recently. Though due to my exceptional circumstances I wrote the attached letter. Today I received the attached response and I feel totally devastated that Enron Europe will not compensate me fairly for how they have affected my life and that of my family's. I read in Enron's literature that you care about your employees and their families, and feel that your code of ethics should have offered me protection against the circumstances that I find myself in, but to my complete and utter dismay I find this is not the case and  in my experience I have suffered a great deal and this seems to have been totally ignored in the response letter. I haven't once been contacted by Enron Europe to see how I'm coping and give me any support whatsoever. They are showing no care or concern for me or my family. I write to you for help in this matter and to conclude this stressful situation that I find myself in due to your company. Under the circumstances and increased stress that the response letter has put upon me, I would be most grateful if you would respond to me as soon as possible.

I know that you are extremely busy and receive numerous requests on a daily basis. I have been an employee with Enron for almost two years. I have spent most of my time on the Liquids trading floor as a Risk Manager for the financial crude book. I was recently recruited by Fred Lagrasta to work in his midmarketing group. I am responsible for supporting our originators in New York. My years at Enron have taught me not only the business aspects of the energy industry, but to strive to pursue your dreams and accept nothing but the best from yourself. It has been a dream of mine to attend law school since I was little. II feel like I am at the time in my life that I can sucessfully pursue this dream. I am interested in studying corporate law at the University of Houston Law Center and participating in their part-time program while maintaining my employment with Enron. I recently spoke with Don Schroeder, a physical crude trader here at Enron, who suggested sending you an e-mail asking if you would be so kind as to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf. I would be honored if you would write the university a letter recommending me to their part-time program. I am hoping to make the early decision deadline of November 1st. I understand that you do not know me at all, however I would be more than willing to come visit with you if you had time and/or forward you my resume and performance evaluations. I know that I would represent Enron well by attending the University of Houston. I worked full-time throughout my college career at Texas A&M University to help finance my education. I am a hard worker and take pride in everything that I do. I know that I will be successful in law school as well as excel with my career at Enron.

426,"Bush Economic Team ""Inept"" ","This is from a morning briefing that goes out to all of the Schwab clients:  So it's a near-certainty that more stimulus is coming from Washington. But the details change constantly, as trial balloons are floated and shot down day after day. Some quick highlights: ? In stark contrast to its foreign policy/defense team, the Bush economic brain trust looks inept, unable to coordinate its plans and apparently unwilling to provide much direction to Congress. ? Filling that vacuum are Republicans who want big tax cuts and Democrats who want to spend much more. ? This means the budget surplus in fiscal 2002 is in free fall. It's possible that the budget could go into deficit this year, but our guess is that it will be in the black by a little, probably under $50 billion. But these estimates aren't worth much right now - the big story is that the surplus is melting fast.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

428,Cooler Houston Project/ Follow-Up to Denver Discussion ,"May 29, 2001  Dear Ken:  It was great to see you in Denver. The group of  leaders from the Western Governors' Association and major businesses  were energized to take control of their destiny, and your ideas contributed enormously. I think that you and I are very much on the same page regarding the President's Energy Report and the opportunities that it presents. In addition, Joe Romm and I have worked  a bit with the Enron Energy Services team on some initial ways to highlight and quantify the ""green"" aspects of the EES product. You are well positioned to prove what initiatives bring both business and energy/environmental benefits. Per our discussion, I have attached below a copy of a confidential preliminary report on the potential for a ""Cooler Houston"" initiative. The scientific models relating to ""urban heat island effects"" indicate that planting trees, lightening the color of roofs and resurfacing pavement with lighter material can reduce ambient high temperatures in Houston and thus potentially lead to ozone reductions far cheaper than the cost of the ""last mile"" tons indicated in current SIP efforts. Success requires developing some technical agreement and common cause among U.S. EPA, TNRCC, the City of Houston, and business and civic leaders in the City. Bill White and the leadership of the Greater Houston Partnership have been spearheading early work on this. Our team is working with U.S. EPA and TNRCC to see if they can agree on the models. We would be very interested in your ideas on this. Moreover, if the technical people can agree in concept, we would value your support of an achievable Cooler Houston plan going forward. Naturally, the plan is exciting because it offers economic, air quality and broader quality-of-life benefits to the Houston community. Ever since we developed the acid rain trading program, I have enjoyed promoting such ideas! Please let me know anything else that you need. I hope to see you soon.

439,CA rept requirements rehearing denied ,"Though the electronic copy is not yet available, we have faxed out a hard copy of FERC's ""Order on Rehearing"" issued today in RM01-9, ""Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market."" All requests for rehearing and clarification have been denied, as the requirement ""is in the public interest...[and further] is necessary for the Commission to advise Congress as to whether it should change the existing regulatory framework...""  Some major points are:  (1)    Arguments that FERC cannot require the info. from non-jurisdictional entities is disputed by citation to the NGA and FPA, allowing FERC to collect any information in order to advise Congress on a matter of urgent concern. The Commission also cites the FPA's authorization to investigate electricity issues, including the cost of generation (of which natural gas is a key factor). (2) In response to Enron's arguments, the order states the following: 	Enron argues that the data collection should be undertaken on an as-needed basis, not regularly; FERC simply denies this. Enron argues that the burden of reporting was underestimated; FERC says this may be true but is no reason to rescind the requirement. Enron argues that the reporting is not based on the business method utilized by the company and that it does not have the information on a daily pricing and volume basis (matched to physical volumes); FERC answers that data should be submitted ""in a manner consistent with the way the particular gas seller does business."" Examples are given in the text of the FERC order. If Enron is contending it should only file aggregate information, FERC finds this option unacceptable. Only Enron asked for an extension for the filing deadline, from 30 days to 45 days after the close of each month; FERC denies this request as unnecessary. (3) CPUC request for access to all information filed is denied. Sensitive price data will be exempt from public disclosure (with no exceptions) so that all parties must comply. The order also states, ""Moreover, the purpose in seeking the information is to enable the Commission to understand the operation of the market for gas sales into California, not to investigate the conduct of particular participants in that market.""

445,unused books ,"There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips. O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books. Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed. The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated. There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files. We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website. Let's try to keep these the same format. East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift. West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this. Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions. I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that. I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then. KK  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

What  typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes  to the desk entirely at mid. This is causing some substantial OA variances.

453,USTeleNet Transaction ,"Just to follow-up on our discussion yesterday regarding the accounting treatment assuming that USTeleNet owns the switch and that we purchase the switch and lease it back to them under a ""capital"" lease, the following would occur:  The asset would stay on their books (however it would be ""marked-up"" to FMV as evidenced by the purchase price) They would defer the gain, if any, over the asset's life. They would record a payable on their balance sheet and recognize interest expense in their P&L as payments are made We would record the payment of cash to them and book a receivable and deferred interest income (to be recognized over the lease term)  Essentially we are lending them money equal to the FMV of their asset and receiving interest payments in return (i.e. direct financing lease)  I would be happy to go into more detail at your request.

465,My suggested changes to bullet points re: legal role ,"ENA Legal (TBD) 1. ENA Legal is responsible for deal documentation and legal sign off for the  transaction, and is typically responsible for all transaction-related  agreements documents such as MOUs/MOIs, Participation or Development  Agreements, and any Agreement, which directs the operation of the project  (O&M Agreement, Steam Agreement, Gas Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement,  etc.). 2. ENA Legal represents the interests of  advises the origination and  development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all  legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as  required. and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups. 3. ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax  in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as  required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the  structure. Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA: 1. EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting  documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been  agreed. 2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at  the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same  project. ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of  any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance  with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained. 3. Comments returned to EE&CC  need to either be incorporated in the next  draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with  the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to  vendors. 4. EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to  both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as  possible. Forms of ""standard"" agreements should be discussed/agreed to  enhance consistency. 5. Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction  which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should  be prepared by EECC. EECC should provide information concerning the  existence of such service agreements. 6. ENA Legal would should work closely with EE&CC contract administrators in  drafting equipment in the preparation of contracts which the contracts  personnel have been tasked to prepare. EECC Legal can assist by providing  input, but is not required by ENA to sign off on such contracts.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month.

488,CHAD - Attorney Client Privlege - Confidential ,"Confidential - Attorney Client Privlege  Please give me your thoughts on the attached proposal to resolve the ""dangling chads"" with AEP. I have attached the proposal and a ""value analysis"" of the proposal, both of which I propose to send to AEP. The key benefits of the proposal from Enron's perspective are the following:  1. Removes us from the vagueness and uncapped exposure of the Ducote deal with Entex for additional costs. AEP can capture the economics of future gas deliveres to Entex associated with this capital expenditure. 2. Captures the leverage that AEP will have in the Entex audit. I think for ENA to pursue Entex would be difficult/time consuming and may lead to a tortious interference suit from AEP. 3. Gives up the interest payment we think AEP owes us. This is true value we are giving up, but do we really want to fight with AEP in court over this (to the extent they are not bluffing)? 4. Removes us from having to process imbalances - saving manpower costs and further removing us from hassles with AEP. AEP is better able to capture value from these imbalances then we are, since they have the pipe. 5. Gets us out of the Coastline law suit. I'm pretty sure Coastline is at least owed the $1.4MM that we would contribute. AEP has a chance to minimize any further costs, which are capped by the value of the claim at a further $2.2MM.

499,EnTouch Newsletter ,"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide. The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States. It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets. Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production. The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities. In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system. ENA West Power Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002. With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators. IN THE NEWS  ""To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World. At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies. The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling."" --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

506,European Weather ,"John,  Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather  situation. Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to  review it this week. Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from  a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth  any more of our time. For what it is worth, I think our communication  strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed  to be. These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and  consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well. For a P&L that is  this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this. There  is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to  bigger and better things. I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the  other issues and problems on my plate. Let's discuss upon your return on our  weekly call. Thanks and I hope your vacation was relaxing. Mike   ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

531,Bridgeline Partnership and Storage/Transportation Deals ,"Ed and Gerald,  Brian and I spoke with Randy Curry of Bridgeline earlier today regarding a deal that we are trying to put together in order to sell the pad gas (in place) from Storage Caverns #13/#14. During that conversation, Randy indicated that: (i) ENA's default under its storage and transport agreements with Bridgeline impacts the Bridgeline partnership itself (and that there are certain side agreements that spell this out) and (ii) Bridgeline would reject any efforts by ENA to remove its gas inventories from storage facilities owned by Bridgeline. Bridgeline contends that ENA is permitted to pay all past due amounts and provide adequate assurances for future payment on its storage and transport deals as there is a bankruptcy order in place that allows the debtors to pay common carrier liens and warehouseman's liens. I asked Randy whether he had sought a lawyer's opinion regarding whether Bridgeline could be properly classified as a common carrier and/or warehouseman - he said that he had. Gerald please advise regarding Randy's assertions above. Ed, please let me know if you are already looking into either of these matters.

Police, Ferentz probe incident at bar By MEGAN MANFULL and TOM WITOSKY Register Staff Writer 09/28/2001  Iowa City, Ia. - A criminal investigation is under way into an alleged assault that involves at least one member of the Iowa football team. Tom Widmer, an Iowa City police captain, said Wednesday that the investigation began early Sunday morning after police responded to a call from a bar named Etc. The tavern is located in the downtown Iowa City pedestrian mall. ""It is an active investigation,"" Widmer said. Widmer said police received the call about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. He declined to identify any suspects. Ryan Rooney, a manager at Etc., said at least one assailant was a member of the Iowa football team. He would not identify the player or say if more than one player was involved. Rooney said one of his bartenders sustained a concussion from the assault and required medical attention. ""It was more of a jumping than a fight,"" he said. Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said Thursday morning he was looking into the matter. He said he was told of the incident Wednesday evening. ""I'm fuzzy on the details right now,"" Ferentz said. ""A player told a coach about something that took place, and then they told me. I'm going to look into what happened and get more details about it. ""I want to find out if anything did happen . . . then I will see if any action needs to be taken on the team."" Iowa's season already has been marred by one violent assault. Offensive lineman Sam Aiello attacked quarterback Jon Beutjer in July, although the incident did not become public until the first week of the season. Beutjer said he received a concussion, although he did not file a report with police. He later left Iowa and enrolled at Illinois, saying he felt betrayed by the school's handling of the incident. Ferentz said he had not been contacted by police about the incident at Etc. A report obtained from police says two people were injured at Etc. Rooney said the second victim, a woman, was ""shaken up pretty bad."" Kevin Prestegard, the investigating officer, confirmed Thursday the probe was continuing, but refused further comment. ""It all depends on the police and how diligently they will pursue this,"" Rooney said. ""They have a lengthy amount of time before they have to do something. If they are season ticket holders, I wouldn't be surprised if they wait until December."" Police declined to respond to Rooney's comment.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template. Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts. I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on. Are we close to having a final version? Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

We basically would park gas in their facility until Jan./04 to provide pressure. We are making two (mutually exclusive) proposals. Proposal 1: Park 2 Bcf of gas on October and November 01 (33,000/day), this gas would be delivered at the Lone Star WA line where it connects to the Hill Lake storage facility (Hill Lake is building a lateral that would connect to the bigger and better connected Lone Star's ""X"" line, this will be ready by the time we pull out our gas). Redeliver the gas to ENA at the interconnect of the Falcon lateral to the ""X"" line on January 04 (66,000/day). The redelivery would be done all in one month (the lateral and compressors would be in place to allow for delivery in one month). Proposal 2:  Same transaction as #1 except that: We may get the option to convert 10% of our base gas to working gas (and therefore withdraw it) on the previous January (03).

546,Oakhill Power Update ,"Here is an update on Oakhill power sourcing:        Wholesale Generation + Ancillaries ? Electric cooperatives and municipalities are exempt from retail deregulation. We can not directly contract with AEP or whoever the wholesale generation provider would be because it constitutes a retail sale in a non-deregulated area. The prevailing utility in the area must be the buyer of the power. ? Generation + ancillaries will be provided by the chosen entity, through NTEC, and then through Rusk. The wholesale generation + ancillaries contract will be a three party agreement between AEP (or whoever is chosen), NTEC, and Rusk. ? Swing - There are consumption penalties for using more or less than the contracted 5.0 MW 7x24 block (meaning there is no free swing). These penalties are part of the ancillary services, which means that we will not have the exact specifications until Rusk receives the bids on their RFP on 6/27/01. T&D ? T&D is provided directly by Rusk County Electric Co-Op. ? NTEC is charging us $0.20 / MW as an administrative fee (mark up), which is why the fixed T&D cost from Rusk County is $10.20/MW and not $10.00/MW. ? There will be a minimum T&D charge from Rusk, above which we pay for only what we use: o	For example:  We pay the minimum charge or actual usage, whichever is higher. Ricki is constructing the T&D only contract (which he claims will be similar in structure to the previous contract), with the inclusion of T&D pricing and swing.

547,Enron Compression Services Proposal ,"Andy,  Per our recent discussions, you will find a proposal from Enron Compression Services to provide HP Services to KNG Energy to meet it growth expectations (either as is or through a new joint venture/ownership structure from the current bidding process). We have made this proposal to conform with the expansion scenarios outlined in the offering memorandum and have provided flexibility for a 60%-90% load factor to be utilized for both stations. We would be happy to have a tele-conference to go through this proposal with you. You will also note that the latter part of the presentation begins to outline additional options (on a notional value basis) that we can put into a deal to increase the value of the deal over the proposed 10-year term. We took a look at the strategic value of the underlying assets that were offered and were unfortunately not able to come up with a structure that we could support for either the purchase or re-capitalization of KNG Energy's assets. We appreciate the opportunity to bid on these assets and are happy to work with you to optimize our proposal to fit the ultimate owner's needs for expansion. I have also attached our group's brochure and a copy of a recent article about our group in Gas Daily. Once again, thank you for the opportunity and I will call you in the near future to discuss this proposal further. Chris Hilgert Director Enron Compression Services        The parties hereto understand and agree that the PROPOSAL sets forth each party's preliminary understanding of the proposed transactions with KNG EnerGY and Enron compression services. This PROPOSAL does not create and is not intended to create a binding and enforceable contract between the parties or a duty on the part of any party hereto to negotiate in good faith toward a binding contract and may not be relied upon by either party as the basis for a contract by estoppel or otherwise, but rather this proposal evidences a non-binding expression of the understanding of each party to endeavor, without obligation, to negotiate the terms of a proposed transaction.

Thus the language needs to clearly identify  that this is a payment guaranty. As long as Transco gets paid for the  transport, I am not sure why this matters. 2. Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their  tariff. Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the  ability to recover double interest on late payments. Thus, the interest  language in the guaranty was removed. Please review the revised guaranty. I would be happy to discuss these issues  with Transco's attorney's at their convenience. Let me know if you have any  questions. Thanks.

The  ""Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures"" only are the method by which this  is effected. This change needs to be removed. 2. 1st Sentence of Second Paragraph  - The remainder of the changes to the  1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK. Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct  terminology under the Purchase Agreement. All we are doing here is effecting  the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already  agreed. 3. The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be  stricken. The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create  a firm purchase deal with this letter. 4. 1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from ""that quantity of Gas.....  to.......... (the ""Released Gas"""" should be removed. The term Released Gas  is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in  this letter. I am OK with ENA ""hereby"" agreeing to waive any and all rights  it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas. However,  the term rights ENA  ""may"" have needs to be stricken. ENA's position is that we have the right to  recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days.

Fritz wanted to eliminate the ""demand"" requirement in Section 4 and make collateral posting automatic. 4. Should we eliminate the consent requirement in the last sentence of Section 5(a) (reducing LC's)? 5. Reliant wanted to delete the ""mid point"" language in the definition of Current mark to Market value. 6. Reliant wants to add to Section 6(b)(iii) the phrase ""Secured Party notifies the Pledging party as to the"" after the 1 and 5 day triggers such that the delivery requirement begins after notice. 7.

679,Tags ,"As you should now be aware the preschedulers were unable to get all of their tags in by the tagging deadline on Friday. Cara has left a color coded sheet of delayed tags that the real time group must implement between 4 hours  and 1 hour prior to the power flowing. Please take a look at this sheet when coming in on shift. Also, there are two tags that need special attention tomorrow (7/2) evening. Tag numbers 25843 and 25870 have been printed out and attached to Cara's list. These two tags were flowing through the CISO and needed to be checked out day ahead by PacifiCorp and the ISO. Unfortunately the ISO and PAC needed real tags not delayed tags in order to allow PACs schedule to flow. Therefore per my discussion with Dick Dowdy at PAC, he has created a tag showing the total of 35 MW coming out of his system (tag # 9152Y) in order to check out with the ISO. THE REAL TIME GROUP MUST DO THE FOLLOWING ON THE PAC TAGS: 1. send the delayed tags out prior to the times indicated on Cara's sheet but no sooner than 4 hrs prior to energy flow. 2. On the pacificorp tags referenced above, please call PAC after sending the delayed tags and tell them to kill their tag number 9152Y. 3. Call the ISO to inform them of the tag change and give them the delayed tag numbers. 4.  call PSCO and inform them you have submitted the tags. Please make sure this is happens ! If this is not taken care of the schedule won't flow and  Enron will be charged liquidated damages by PacifiCorp. If you have ANY questions regarding these tags or any other tags on Cara's list, do not hesitate to contact Cara, Bill, or myself on this matter.

683,Crescendo ,"After meeting with Jesus Melendrez this morning, meeting with the Crescendo folks for a few minutes this afternoon (they were in the office in connection with other matters) and talking with the Crescendo lawyer on the phone, I called Chris Sullivan to let him know that his letter to Jim Derrick had been referred to me for handling. I started my conversation with Mr. Sullivan by telling him that I had no substantive knowledge about this matter and that I had talked with the Crescendo folks briefly about his letter and expected that they would respond to the substantive points he raised ""sooner rather than later"". Mr. Sullivan was not thrilled with this response indicating that he already knew what Crescendo had to say on the subject. In fact, this was an interesting comment since, at other times during our call, he mentioned that he had been waiting for a reply from Crescendo for months. He then went on for some time about how he had been talking to Crescendo and others about his helium rights for up to 2 years (his time estimates changed as he continued to talk) and that he believed the project was scheduled to go on line in early November and still had not received a satisfactory response from Crescendo. He also mentioned a call to Keith Pruitt at Enron in February and that he hadn't heard back from him either. It sounded to me like Mr. Sullivan wanted Enron to support his position and intervene on his behalf against Crescendo based only on his letter. In any event, Mr. Sullivan again threatened to involve the government and go forward with litigation to prevent helium from being wasted. I reiterated that I could not discuss his substantive concerns, that I was not yet up to speed on this matter and that we would look into it. I received from Jesus copies of the correspondence between Crescendo and Mr. Sullivan as well as a legal opinion on Crescendo's obligations, if any, to Mr. Sullivan. Also included in the information I received were copies of the letters exchanged between Crescendo and the BLM on this matter. I am in the process of reviewing these and expect to talk to Crescendo's attorney this weekend. In the meantime, he is working on a response to the substantive points raised in Sullivan's letter. Please call with any questions or comments.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

686,Updating Capacities ,"After talking with Terry, Darrell, and the team, the following procedures have been developed so that each team member is consistent and all pertinent information is properly documented. Darrell is going to set the Socal Capacity in CAS to its Operational Capacity (850000), therefore, from now on we should only update the Socal window in TMS, and opt not to send the capacity from TMS to CAS when asked. In addition, we should continue to update the comments section in CAS each cycle for the Socal Window For all other points, when updating Capacities in TMS, the changed capacity should be sent to CAS only if it is a change in Operational Capacity. If we are updating for any other reason, (flow rate etc...) those capacities should not be sent back to CAS. In conclusion, from now on we will only update capacities in TMS and we will only send changes to CAS or make changes in CAS if there is a change in Operational Capacity, which will probably be a decision made by Darrell. The Socal Capacity in CAS and online is 850000 however we will continue to document the Window in the CAS Comments, and update it in TMS. These procedures will be effective for the Timely of Gas Day 10/25/01. If you have any questions, please ask me. Thanks!  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.
687,Requested pressure cut at Citizens Griffith TW Interconnect ,"Citizens had concerns about the amount of noise and vibration at our Citizens Plant Station and has recently had an expert on this subject visit the site and take measurements. The preliminary report indicates that the current configuration could potentially fail at full load conditions with a inlet pressure exceeding 740 psig. Since Citizens does not want to limit the capacity of the power-plant, we are asking that your delivery pressure be temporarily reduced to 700 psig. I have attempted to document the different operation modes that we have observed your station operating under along with any back-ground information that I was able to document. As discussed, in the design phase of this interconnect, I was informed that batching would only occur under low flow conditions, and do not understand the benefit of batching in the manner that was done earlier this year. Per our customers request (Griffith Energy) Citizens installed equipment capable of measuring down to extremely low flow rates that include three measurement runs. A 10"" Instrument Ultrasonic, a 4"" Invensys Turbine meter, and a 2"" Instrumet Rotary meter. Although I questioned this requirement at the time, the low flow condition occurs so rarely, it is inconsequential. I have analyzed our log files for the month of November (11/1/01-12/6/01) and found that the only time the smaller runs operate is momentarily as the power plant starts up. The following volumes are accumulated totals per run for this time period. Run Size        TW      Flow (Mcf)     Percent of Flow                              EPNG    Flow (Mcf)        Percent of Flow  2""                                   107.9              0.0089%                          0.2            0.0018%  4""                      1,280.8              0.1059%                                                 2.1                  0.0153% 10""                         1,208,076.9            99.8852%                                          13,714.4                99.9829% My point is that in the event that you do not feel comfortable in setting your actuated valve immediately downstream of your flow control valve to take Citizens' requested pressure cut, consider temporarily using the flow control valve as  pressure control. The month of November included considerable power-plant testing, and therefore the above numbers are higher that during commercial operation. When TW found it's in a difficult situation in regards to finding a solution to measuring a low flow (which appears to be erroneous information), Citizens worked with you in good faith.

He also sounded  interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at  FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue. Obviously they are very  leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their  identity. He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders. Also, he mentioned  that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney  will be taking over in his absence. That could be good, or it could be bad.

699,So true... ,"No one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all Ted. Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me. I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr. old girl with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class than him. Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than him (while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2. I am a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual. Merely taking into account those two points, Ted in his present ""condition"" could never be a match for me. I would either always feel like I was carrying him or rolling over him.

724,Enron Corp. equity derivatives transactions on Enron Corp. stock ,"Bill:  I have previously discussed this issue with Rod. I would like to  revisit once again. These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE  stock. There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools  more frequently than in the past. I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp.  securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely  involved. Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to  Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved. At a minimun,  even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty  capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each  confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on  behalf of Enron Corp.).

There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France,  insurance companies, broker types, etc.) .For example, one murky designation  includes ""persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to  their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do  not prohibt the carrying on of investment services"".

772,I'd suggest the following: ,"Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to  the distinction between ""investor owned utilities"" (or ""IOUs"") and municipal  utilities (or ""municipals"") in connection with derivatives activity. In the  U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates. Thus,  we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an  Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance  in its state public utility commission proceedings. A copy of that  Additional Termination Event is attached for your review. Our approach with  respect to municipals is dramatically different. When negotiating an ISDA  Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S.  Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of  ""Incipient Illegality"" and an enforceability opinion. A copy of that  Schedule is also attached for your reference. We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada,  and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when  a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government  may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy). In that regard, would you  recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities  and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format?

785,Your campus visit ,"Jeff and Christie:  It was a pleasure having you here on campus. Let me add my thanks to those of the Entrepreneurial Manager faculty who actually taught the case. I think your presence added enormously to the success of the maiden voyage of this case. As I indicated to you, I want to make the case even stronger by incorporating any additional data or suggestions that you may have after seeing it taught. Jeff, you indicated you had a couple of quick corrections, and I'd appreciate receiving those. Also if you have any thoughts about how we might enrich the case, those would be welcome too. Christie, as indicated in our discussions, I think some sense of the economics of Enron Online would be enormously helpful. Even if we have to use disguised data, can we break out the sales and profitability of the trading operations before the launch of Enron Online. With some indication of what the new Internet-based model will do to margins, students can do some simple calculations of the volume necessary to compensate, and therefore have some idea of the enormously ambitious (and significantly risky) venture that this turned out to be. I will gladly talk further about this with you directly or with whomever you want to put me in touch with.

788,Noble Systems Executive Update + Opportunities For You ,"Jeffrey,  ATOMS continues to establish itself to be the most effective and reliable predictive dialer in the world! Previous users of other predictive systems continue to report production improvements of typically 20% with ATOMS. Please check out several new customer success stories, updates, press releases and feature enhancements at www.noblesys.com  Noble Systems is now initiating a new program where our friends like you can receive $1,000.00 plus for each new customer that you refer to me. These referral commissions are applicable on only new leads going forward. You must sign up for this program in advance and register the lead. If you wish to do so, please advise and I'll forward this sign-up information to you. Also, in part because of the combined calling of Noble Systems users along with the 16,000 agents working for Teleperformance (our $700 million plus parent), we can now also secure for you a 2.5 cent per minute call rate on T1 traffic. And you need not even be a Noble Systems user to take advantage of this package. Please advise and I'll get this information to you. Current hot items on our product side include extending our skills-based routing from inbound to answering outbound predictive traffic. In addition to now providing fully automated credit card authorizations, our integrated IVR (Interactive Voice Response) can also do just about any application including automated surveys, automated appointment confirmations, etc. And, most importantly, PerfectScript can now improve both agent productivity and agent retention more than any single innovation in the past several years. With PerfectScript, agents may pre-record portions of their presentations, rebuttals, mirandas etc. At their discretion, the appropriate pre-recorded voice segment plays in lieu of the agent responding; totally seamless and without clicks etc. so that the other party is not aware that the agent is not really speaking. At any time your agent may stop the recorded play by simply touching the keyboard space bar and continue in his/her own voice. Another PerfectScript benefit is that the enthusiasm with which they record their rebuttals tends to be maintained throughout every conversation for optimal results. And yet another very important benefit of PerfectScript is that agents may pre-record their initial call introduction: ""Hello, this is Dan. May I speak with"" at which point your agent then speaks the called party's name and continues on. Jeffrey, have a great week and whenever I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to call or email me back.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

I've told people that  you are my business hero for several years now. It seems a little unfair that you would now vie for the ""personal life"" hero as well, so I'll hold that title in abeyance for the moment. It goes without saying that if there were ever any way to work together, the firm (not that firm) and I would be honored. 3. On the trip back, I've been reading Katharine Graham's autobiography.

794,MS Society Opportunity ,"Jeff,   On Saturday, September 29th, I am being honored with the National Multiple Sclerosis  Society's Hope  Award during their  annual Maxine Mesinger Dinner of  Champions event. This award is beinggiven to me due to the hard work and  dedication that BMC Software  employees have shown this great cause through the years. I understand that you were the recipient of this award last year, so you know  that the key to a successful event is the selection of the dinner  committee, which is then used to  build the invitation list and to build excitement for attending the event from  local leaders. Of course, the  key to successfully developing the dinner committee is the selection of the  Chairman of the committee. I would be honored  if you would agree to serve as the Chairman of the dinner committee. You were  the first name that came to mind and the best person I could hope for to assure  a successful event. I am told that your personal time commitment would be  very minimal. It would require your attendance at the dinner event on  September 29th in downtown Houston. The dinner is typically from 7:00pm until 10:00pm,but the actual ceremony is less  than 30 minutes long with some brief comments by you and then an acceptance  speech given by yours truly. The primary obligation beyond attending the  event would be to allow us to use your name and signature in sending out the  invitations to the dinner committee members. I would provide you with a  recommended invitation list. The MS team would make sure that  your time and image would be well respected.

817,DA and HA finals ,"Group, We have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals, with SQL errors, and as a result we have not been able to run reports. If it is a weekend (or holiday), we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS. After this is done we can import HA finals, and create the HA report. If the boxes are not checked, the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours. Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published, or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in. Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually. Once all the finals are in the load zones and int. interchanges, you should be able to create the final report.

We finally have  established a day and night routine for him and I'm happy to report that I'm  starting to get more sleep which is nice. I'm still running and playing alot  of tennis which has helped me keep my sanity. I have really enjoyed my stay  at home. It's nice to be able to watch  your kids grow up and both Arthur  and Charles I think have really benefitted from us both being home with  them. I feel very fortunate. I would really like to have lunch with you in the next few weeks so that I  can catch up on what has been going on and begin discussing with you my  thoughts about returning to work.

I have  asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding  exposure so that we can priortize our efforts. I think that the main issues  to cover on Friday involve:  1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard  langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to  whether NY or Texas law applies. 2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties. For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a  list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree  with the terms of such deals. I'll have David D. send up a sample. 3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online. I'm available anytime to talk about the above.

829,ISDA Tax Issue ,"Rhett: You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of  our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term ""Indemnifiable Tax"".

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to  eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's  jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis  for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur). It  thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes. Do you think that we can or should accept this?

837,"disruptive technology, short and simple and confidential ","We produce political/public affairs television programs which air in state capitols. Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio, expanding into NJ, Md and DE. The disruptive technology is this: the real target of the TV show is the guest, not the audience. Lobbyists have trouble scheduling time with politicians and regulators, and when they get on the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from government decision makers. We don't have trouble with either. Every politician and appointee wants to be on television, they always say yes. When they ask us what the topics will be, and we mention something like telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on television. In addition by inviting journalists and radio and television commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them. In short:   Step one: identify gov't decision makers that our sponsors want to influence Step two: invite them on the program and, in doing so, develop rapport with their key staff members on the relevant issues Step three: send briefing materials and/or give a briefing in person before the the taping Step four: towards the end of a show in which the Newsmaker has largely been bragging about his/her policy agenda Step five: steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics, framing the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to resist the conclusions suggested by the host. Step six: take the statement of support for the position we favor e.g. tort reform, privatization, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. (which by the way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air) and in addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show, we digitize it and send it out to legislators, regulators and the proper beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker to back off later. Current sponsors: Medical Society, Hospital Association, State System of Higher Education, Manufacturers Association, Cornell Corrections, AT&T. Levels: 25K, 50K, 100K per year for Pa; 15k for Ohio (one level only). This is an amazingly simple, elegant and direct way to influence policy makers and opinion molders and we do not have an energy-oriented firms in partnership with us. Enron and Newsmakers are a very good fit. I'll be in touch,   p.s. Sponsorship can be done in ways that are not visible if you prefer, via intermediaries, if you are publicity shy.

843,results of football pool ,"Hello everyone,   	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well. In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon.

877,BVI ,"I've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take  beginners. I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier  thread. I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby. The  only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't  quite ready. I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I  know. They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the  chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10. If you use their  provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there  right on time. Having several people (but not too many) around this time is  helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc. Of  course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option  or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done  on time. Check with your charter company about attending the briefings  before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may  require 2 people from your boat to attend. As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight  on Norman Island. There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as  long as you're not in too late. It shouldn't take more than a few hours to  get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the  engine. There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and  drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you  can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there,  there is at least very little ashore to bother you. The caves are just  around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving  either that afternoon or first thing the next day. Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter. My  advice running roughly clockwise:   skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless  you're clearing customs);   skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time  and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern  shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded'  variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will  let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your  trash on board - there's nowhere to put it);   Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little  Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor  bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book  while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach  bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks;    Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop  and a swim;   don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's  a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and  steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the  channel in is well marked;   if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane  Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of  taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back;   it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the  water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met  that way;   the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a  mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper  Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) -  maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely  moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones  reserved for commercial craft;    I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be  at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze, but if you stay there  you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is  not serious enough about fresh water conservation (and what crew ever is? );   the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower (I think you pay at the resort  front desk) and maybe a 'fancy' dinner and there is also a water dock there  (10 cents a gal.?). Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don't get to sail  enough - you shouldn't have any trouble getting a lot in (but you won't be  able to see everything). The only difficulty might be if you need to get the  boat back in for an early flight but I've let people out at Cane Garden Bay  to take a taxi to the early flight & then sailed around to have the boat back  well before noon. Having said that, I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for  your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely. And  just as I mentioned for the first night, it makes sense to get into most  anchorages early rather than late so you're sure to get a mooring (in those  that have them) and don't have to worry about finding a spot for the boat -  many of them can get quite crowded. Of course, if you're going anytime  between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn't be any trouble with crowds -  just pay daily, close attention to the weather forecasts! Don't expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at  nearly every anchorage - many are closed in the low season. A few of the  islands have some good hiking but there's not much for the sight seers  either. But snorkeling and diving are everywhere. Ask at your chart  briefing for the best spots these days. If you have divers along, don't miss  the wreck of the Rhone - you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and  bring along equipment and a guide for the divers. The cruising guide will  have lots of info on all these issues. Wish I was going - it's always a blast!  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

881,Online Trading contracts ,"Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online  system. I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most  recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that  I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date. They do have the advantage of  being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today. I don't  think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as  starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest  material. The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective  counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper. The first time the  counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required  to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an ""I  Agree"" box after scrolling through the agreement. The GTC's are the  contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master  agreement in place. Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty  to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary. While  most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our  ""Omnibus"" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a ""Deemed  ISDA."" One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two  sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have  no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is  not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call  for collateral if we choose.

882,Enron Entity for Financial Trading ,"Lucy:  Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity  should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties. There are a couple of general rules that apply to ""normal"" trading  circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not  hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances  vary (even just a little bit) from ""normal."" For example, abnormal  situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another  transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment),  the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain  Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron  company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we  are trading (except as spelled out below). Having said all that, the  following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines:  1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an  Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron  company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is  concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty,  Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement. Of  course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading,  Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where  derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or  can't be done by us from the U.S.). 2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or  Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should  be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to  the master agreement. If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other  rules may apply. 3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT  International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is  in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on  behalf of ECT International. Note that there are special considerations if  the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is  actually ""arranged"" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT  International). If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or  U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two  countries for final negotiation and execution. It would be a good idea to  consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice. These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal  counterparty to the transactions. This doesn't determine where within the  Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside. If we want the risk  to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual  purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT)  to get the risk in the right place.

888,Data Problems ,"Paul, I have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at. 1. The number Mother data is pulling for Zone P is wrong. The pointer for the data can be found on the SQL worksheet the expression is: 	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'DAYAHEAD', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_DA, and	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'HOURLY', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_RT,  I have looked at the PJM and NY prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from. 2. The other 24hr desk evidently has been told that the PJM night shift is to prep the PJM and Nepool portions of the shift notes. That is fine with me. I wrote a macro to pull, format and print the Nepool information. The PJM information is not available on the website. The East power portal has something. I think it does some kind of Op Sum pull at some unknown interval. The problem is the information is not accurate. Rob Bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other 24hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting. 2.a All data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata. This makes me doubt that opsum is the source, as edata also pulls from opsum. 2.b When all interfaces and hubs are printing the same, the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website. I have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right. If the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at ""M:\Electric\24hour\PJM AVE\PJMSummary.exe"". If they could fix this app I would care less about the web site. If they do not want to fix the app I can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template. I don't really care how I get the data, I just need to get yesterday's PJM for the shift note. In other news, if you are trading some of the regular products, are you following the DA-RT physical moves? If we do man the 24hr desk (even if Bryce is the day guy) we could cover the DA-RT physical. Having it part of the 24hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the NY side in the early morning. I only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading PJM to spend the same amount of time on the analysis. It is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift.

Maritimes Files Application for Phase IV Expansion Of Natural Gas Pipeline System BOSTON, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. has submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to further expand its natural gas pipeline system. The $250 million expansion project, designated Phase IV, will allow Maritimes to nearly double its capacity to transport natural gas from offshore Nova Scotia to markets in the northeastern United States from approximately 415,000 dekatherms to 800,000 dekatherms per day.

895,Block III Recall Rights ,"Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity:   Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity. While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

900,LADWP Gas Contract ,"Dear Potential Gas Supplier  As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement will come to an end on December 31, 2001. While we will honor current commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to use the spot agreement to buy any more gas. The reason that this is happening is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now. We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of agreement most gas suppliers are familiar. We have the ordinance approved by the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep us operating.

902,Summary of Commission Meeting ,"The Commission meeting yesterday, chaired by Pat Wood, consisted of discussions on FERC's:  Administrative Issues ? Strategic and 2002 Business Plan Priorities for the strategic plan for 2001 through 2005 were outlined yesterday and include a) promoting secure, high-quality environmentally responsible energy infrastructure with consistent policies; b) encouraging competitive markets in lieu of traditional regulation; c) protection of markets/customers through fair market oversight; and d) efficiently running FERC. In reaching these goals, FERC intends several initiatives such as removing impediments to market investment, encouraging use of new technology; continuing to advance competitive markets; addressing landowner, safety and environmental concerns and striving for clarity not only in specific areas such as cost recovery but also in communications to stakeholders. Shortly, Staff will be recommending a twelve-month plan as part of the overall strategic plan. ? Infrastructure Adequacy There will be a series of open commission meetings held throughout the U.S. beginning in November in the West; in December or early spring a meeting will be held in the northeast and later in 2002 for the Midwest and south. The intent is to reach out to the states for greater cohesion. ? California Infrastructure Update Staff concluded that the California natural gas market for take-away capacity was insufficient to accept delivery of all interstate capacity. The California Energy Commission released a report on September 24 that agrees that more expansion in California is needed. Constraint Study FERC will complete a constraint study with associated costs that should be completed by November 7, 2001. Staff cited constraints in central New York state and California. Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or recommendations. It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the resulting costs to consumers. RTO FERC is imposing additional ""incentives"" to encourage the formation or joining in RTOs. The Midwest, Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered at a FERC meeting in October. There will be a series of meetings in ""RTO week"" to focus on congestion management, cost recovery, marketing monitoring, transmission planning, reliability standards and transmission rights. A NOPR is expected to be issued on market design and structure. Marketing Affiliate NOPR, RM01-10 The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both natural gas pipelines and electric utilities. Under the proposal, transmission providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondiscriminatory basis. The rules would be codified in a new section of the regulations and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all ""energy affiliates."" The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusion of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) from the definition of energy affiliates. The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of the rule to public utilities' native load merchant functions. Option A:  Status Quo - the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merchant function. Option B:  The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and would prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of the utility. After extensive discussion, the NOPR was approved 4-0 with additional language added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may not be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties and the States. Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the definition of ""energy"" affiliate and whether there are any energy-type affiliates that would be exempt. Staff responded that the emphasis is on broadening the definition to include all ""energy affiliates"" and no energy-type marketing affiliates would be exempt, except RTO's. The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certain information to all ""energy affiliates"". The rules do not directly govern energy affiliates, but they govern the disclosure of information and the separation of transmission employees, officers and directors from other businesses. Under the proposal, waivers may be requested, if operationally required or under emergency protocols particularly for small systems.

I'm still in the process of reviewing it but the good news is that he is proposing the adoption of the Comprehensive Settlement which Transwestern helped design and supported along with most other participants. The decision does however make some modifications which may not be in our best interest i.e. the adoption of a price cap for secondary market transactions. Due to the lapse in time on this proceeding, Com. Bilas has granted participants the right to file comments by Friday, October 19, 2001.

913,Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project ,"The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio. While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event. The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees. However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past. Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves. The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that. We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous ""Home Video"" to be presented at the Management Conference. The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses. However, there are a few rules to follow. 1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long. 2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000. Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video. Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424. 3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging. They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence. 4.) By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video. To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address. 5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9. 6.) Awards will be given for creativity and humor. The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, ""Enny"" will also be awarded for ""Best Overall Video."" If you have any questions about the ""Home Video"" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

914,Assessment of Global Crossing ,"Greg,  As you asked, I have taken a quick look at Global Crossing. I think it is a close call, but they certainly have a decent shot of making it (by ""making it"" I mean the equity will have value and the company will not be restructured through bankruptcy). Their assets, customers, and cash might marginally outweigh the debt load that the company has. Most importantly, they definitely have a currency (Global Crossing stock) that has more value than anything in EBS. If there is a potential deal to contribute assets of EBS into Global Crossing in exchange for equity, then I would recommend pursuing it even if it means contributing up to $100 million in cash to get it done. However, I would make sure that Enron has no more contingent liabilities, consolidated burn or cash commitments. The real question is will Global Crossing want what we have at any price. I suspect that once they perform due diligence, they will ""run away"" (just as the knights did when faced with the killer rabbit in Monte Python's Search for the Holy Grail).

915,cost cutting measures - from an Employee/shareholder point of view ,"Dear All, The business units are operating on a lean G&A budget and cut costs whenever we can and making sure that we are efficient. Are there any initiative to do likewise for all corp functions? As an accountant in the business unit, we received corp allocations. The total for corp was more than $700MM. This, of course, excludes Enron Net Work, Enron Property, and Global Finance, which if we include those, the G&A to Enron could well be over $1Billion (not counting the business units G&A). The number just blew me away. I think we need to make sure all functions are needed and are run efficiently. We cannot say it's OK just because we can allocate to the business units because the business units may not receive benefits for these costs. We sure don't want Enron, as a whole, to be growing so fat and so fast that it will hurt our bottom line. I'm sorry if I'm out of line, but I really do care about Enron and am very proud to be its employee. Thank you for your time.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

919,CalPERS ,"Mark, Jeff and Greg,  There has been some recent noise at CalPERS regarding Enron, some of which you may be aware. I wanted to update you in case any questions were raised tomorrow on the conference call. In October CA state Senator Steve Peace sent a letter to the CEO of PERS raising ""questions about the prudence of CalPERS continuing to invest and partner with Enron under its current management"". I discussed this with the Alternative Investment (AIM) staff (with whom I deal with regularly regarding JEDI II). They indicated at the time that a senior staff meeting was being held (on Friday Nov 2nd) to discuss the letter and how PERS might respond. Subsequent to that, staff informed me that the board had put Enron on the agenda to discuss during today's (Tuesday the 13th) Investment Committee meeting. I have not received an update as yet today on today's meeting. The fact that the board was meeting to discuss Enron has been reported in the media. Meanwhile, on Friday the 9th, Dan Szente the CIO resigned from PERS. Articles indicate it may be a result of 7.2 percent loss in the funds' investments. PERS holds approx 2.6 million shares of Enron. This has also been mentioned in articles discussing Dan's resignation - thus attempting to link his resignation with our poor performance?? Earlier in the year their proxy vote indicated they owned 3.5 million shares. [BTW - they voted against Item 1 - specifically mentioning Lay, Wakeham and Winokur as having relationships with Enron that could cause conflicts of interest.} PERS assets total $151 billion. It appears they may have liquidated some of their position. I am not sure but I think their position has been one they have held for a long time - possibly since beginning our relationship with JEDI back in 1993. The JEDI II partnership has been a successful partnership for PERS and current IRRs indicate they could earn in excess of 50% on their investment based on the September 30 capital account. This of course, assumes we can liquidate the assets in JEDI I for their current fair value. Also - PERS purchased approx. 7.2 million shares in NPW for $40 million - a cost basis of $5.50 a share.

925,US Responds to Terror #5 ,"Afghanistan Ground War  We believe plans are progressing for ground action in Afghanistan to begin over the next week. Rumsfeld and Bush are both overseas and it is unlikely that the attack would commence prior to their return. Forces earmarked for deployment include US Marines, US Rangers and British Marines. The Pentagon has reportedly suggested to London that it reclassify its marine commandos and paratroopers as ""special forces"" so the operation may still be depicted as an SF one. The tactical aims of such operations - which will see troops inserted by helicopter from Pakistan and then extracted via the same route - will be to destroy identified Al Qaeda targets in areas theoretically under Taleban control. Anthrax  More incidents today with media outlets and politicians being the primary targets. There is a wide variety of media reporting on this, most of it unreliable. We reiterate that the U.S. government is equipped to handle isolated incidents of cutaneous anthrax exposures, but is not equipped to handle air-dispersed anthrax attacks on a wider scale, or more contagious biological weapons such as smallpox. The main impact of the current incidents (aside from those directly affected) is psychological; a further escalation of the sense of worry, which increases both political and economic pressure on the Bush Administration. Politically, there will be increased pressure ""to do something"" not only against the bin Laden network, but possibly Iraq. Economically, the anthrax incidents are simply another serious blow to consumer confidence. The Congressional incidents also are delaying passage of the fiscal stimulus package. Terrorist Sophistication Targeting Critical Infrastructure Not to be Overlooked  The anthrax incidents also represent yet another attack against US critical infrastructure. Just as the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks represented attacks on our transportation infrastructure, financial infrastructure, and government infrastructure, so too do the anthrax attacks target our government infrastructure (Congress, Gov. Pataki) and our communications infrastructure (Fox/CBS/ABC/NBC & mail delivery). Both the September l1th attacks and the anthrax incidents have hit targets that are significant both as critical infrastructure and as symbols of American power. The threat at Three Mile Island reported last night suggests that the possibility of attacks against energy infrastructure should certainly not be ignored and should probably be expected.

945,Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14 ,"Here are my notes from today's call. As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject. Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review. Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS). Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns. Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion. An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets. Under Review:  EGM, EIM. These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability. Required resource levels are being carefully studied. Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates. Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter. These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets. Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn. Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says. Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy. Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity. Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt. McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles: Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets. It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors). The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets. Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation). The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies. The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water. As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required. If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt. This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances. Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'. It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals). As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup. Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity. The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  ",Summarize the email and create a subject line.

The current environment could also=  make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn'= t a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could b= e announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to ass= ume roughly $1 billion in debt.=20 Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment. If a transaction is consu= mmated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agree= ment to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell=  apart in part because of the California energy crisis. A purchase of Port= land General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a ma= rket capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more t= han 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Was= h. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million cu= stomers in Oregon. The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whos= e executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwe= st's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating office= r of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. =  By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in=  its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when price= s are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people fami= liar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is s= omewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transa= ction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in N= orthwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the t= ransaction with debt and equity offerings. Shares of Northwest Natural wer= e trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York St= ock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10. For E= nron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-yea= r ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break=  into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility busines= s proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selli= ng off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And Ca= lifornia's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less = attractive place for Enron to do business. Enron, which also owns a major = gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and busine= sses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of phys= ical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere. It isn't clear where Enr= on will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale.

964,ClickPaper transition ,"FYI. The ClickPaper group in Industrial Markets asked my permission to be able to say, ""ClickPaper will be upgraded to operate via the EnronOnline platform."" I have asked them to delete the reference to EnronOnline and simply claim that this is a new version with many enhancements and new features. While it may seem like their message gives a plug to EnronOnline, I think it will confuse the audience on what exactly is the relationship between ClickPaper and EnronOnline. Also, we have little control over how Industrial Markets will promote ClickPaper and I don't want the market to think that any issues with ClickPaper somehow are a poor reflection on EnronOnline.
