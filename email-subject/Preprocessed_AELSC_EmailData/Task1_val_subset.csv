6,Summarize the email and create a subject line.,"Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of  the agreement:   How are we setting the heat rate? Do we have the GADS (?)? Is it a daily  average, weekly average? Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often? Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions? We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right? We aren't making money on gas, right? Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to  the picture? Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits? It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the  following, in words and/or formulae:  The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost)  formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to  work on. Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost  of power)? How are we setting the bogey? Formula? Subject to audit? Two  bogeys or one (gas and oil)? What is defn of profit? I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or  two would be helpful as a reality check. What costs are included on the buy  and sell side? Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split  costs/profits? Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power? It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these  questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

7,Summarize the email and create a subject line.,"All, 	I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates. Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly. They cited the following reasons for this:  1. An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff. 2. The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects. They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance. 3. A decrease in overall market volumes. GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections. The CAISO points out their costs will remain flat from 2001 to 2002. They anticipate volume levels next year similar to what current volumes are, thus reducing the amount of megawatts they can effectively spread out their GMC charges over. I have the following observations:  1. Despite the decrease in volumes, and the decrease in overall market activity, the CAISO has no plans to reduce its current workforce of 500+ employees. 2. When posed the question: Is CERS charged GMC for out of market energy? Their answer was circumspect at best. 3. The CAISO currently does not assess GMC charges to ancillary service volumes, they indicated however that they are strongly considering changing this policy to increase the denominator that they can spread out GMC. The CAISO would also like to point out that these increases are worse case scenarios, and may not be this high. But as we are all aware, in the California energy market, the worst-case scenario ends up looking optimistic in comparison to what actually ends up happening. Below is a detailing of the changes.
